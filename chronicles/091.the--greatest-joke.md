- <em>Sit  down, please</em>.

<p align="center">***</p>
He's sitting on his bed, head in hands. All  bravado has gone out of him. His hands, now rubbing his eyes, don't feel like  they belong to him anymore. They feel like ghosts, attached to him by some  strange mechanism he has no control over.

He doesn't want to look up, because he'll  see the pictures on the walls – of loved ones lost, of glories past – and he  will remember how alone he is. There's a certificate there, too, somewhere, for  working in deep-space environments. He worked as a miner on asteroids, an  incredibly dangerous task that paid well. The men in his family worked in the  same way, and most of them have died. He's the last one, of the men, of the  family, of everything. And soon, he'll be gone as well.

And yet ... and yet he knows that it  doesn't matter, if he'll only allow his grief to fall away like the old skin it  is. He doesn't want to take his mind off it, because that'll only mean he's  running away. Instead, he focuses; he gazes inward with a burning stare,  willing himself to look his fate directly in the eye. He doesn't blink. He  doesn't blink.

After a while, he feels something give way  under the force of his stare, and his mood shifts from victimization to purpose.  He accepts the joke of life. He feels the sorrow lift from him. He begins to  feel that nothing is impossible.

He starts browsing through pamphlets.

Instant response to most of them is to toss  them in the garbage. There's nothing they can do for him that'll change things,  nothing they can tell him that he doesn't already know.

When he gets to the card from the Sisters,  he almost throws it away like everything else. Then he notices what the card  actually says.

The card has a phone number, and below  that, the line, "This is not what you think."

He frowns, and calls the number. When a  voice answers, it asks him how he got the contact info.

He's silent for a little while. The voice  waits patiently. Then he starts telling it who he is and what has happened.

<p align="center">***</p>
<em>The  voice came from a TV box. There was an avatar on the screen: his AI doctor. You  didn't get a human doctor unless you were a pilot, or willing to pay an  exorbitant fee.</em>

<em>-  We've received the results of the blood test, the voice said. The avatar moved  its lips in sync with the words, and didn't smile. That's when he knew it was serious</em>.

<p align="center">***</p>
He meets the Sister at a café. Over a cup  of tea, she makes him an offer.

"The doctors are reliable," she  says, stirring the tea with a spoon that she then sets aside. "They only  give that card to people whose entire profiles - psych, medical, economy,  everything - match what we're looking for. So we know you're right for  us."

"And now I need to know whether you're  right for me," he replies, and sips his coffee.

"Precisely," she says, and pulls  out some boxes from her bag. They're each the size of a fist, identical, made  of marble. "What I'm about to tell you might sound incredible," she  continues, "but you'll need to take a lot of things on faith from now on.  There are forces in this universe. Some of them good, some evil. Occult, even. And  one of those forces, an evil one, is attempting to disrupt various spiritual  lines, to influence the world in various ways. The Sisters have set up a task  force to uproot it."

He stares her directly in the eye. "I  don't believe you," he says. "Actually, I think you're crazy, and  those boxes probably contain the eyeballs of your past victims or  something."

She suppresses a grin and orders the boxes  in front of him, three in a line. "Pick one."

He does. She opens it. The box contains a  small marble, purple and opaque. The instant he sees it, he's flooded with a  sense of well-being. Worries melt away, acceptance and joy light up inside of  him, and the future, bleak as it is, seems like the best thing that could  happen to him.

She closes the box, and the feeling fades  away. She opens the other two boxes; they're empty.

"Very few people respond," she  says. "But I saw that you did. You're attuned to them, which means you can  find them."

"What do you want me to do?" he  asks.

"Look away," she says. He does,  and hears her re-order the boxes. Eventually he looks back, points at one box,  and it contains the marble. They do this several times, and he always picks the  right box. Every time it's opened, it makes him feel alive and happy. Yet when it's  closed he doesn't need more; he's content with that brief glimpse. He mentions  this to the Sister, and she nods, clearly pleased.

"I don't know what you saw," she  says, "because it's different for everyone. I see snowflakes, gently drifting  about inside the boxes. Other people see colours, and others can only tell by  feel. Your mind picks whatever you can handle.

"I want you to leave your life,"  she says. "Come with us. Help put things right. There aren't many people  who can do what we're asking you to do."

He's still not sure. Then again, he thinks,  what does he have to lose?

<p align="center">***</p>
<em>- The  results are not good. I'm sorry, the AI said.</em>

<em>He knew  it wasn't sorry, that it was a liar. But he'd known that for a while now, and  he accepted its preprogrammed response as a small comfort</em>.

<p align="center">***</p>
He's aboard the Sisters' ship. They're in  high sec space, scanning for something. He's started to feel the pangs of  impatience but he pushes them down. It's true that he doesn't have any time to  waste, but all that means is that a second spent on aggravation is a second  wasted. He looks around, tries to take everything in as if for the first time. The  metal walls and railings, the lights in the ceiling, the muted greys and greens  worn by people around him. It's all rather low-key and subdued, and yet it's  perfect, if only because it <em>is</em>.

There's a shout, and the crew erupts in cheers.  They've found a marker.

<p align="center">***</p>
<em>He sat  there stunned as the AI told him he had somewhere between six and eighteen  standard months to live</em>. <em>It was nothing they could prevent; at some point the brain would simply  stop sending the commands for lungs to inflate and heart to contract. His mind  would decide it was time to stop. There had been some limited experiments with  automatic equipment, a type of pacemaker, but in order for it to work he  couldn't exert himself under any circumstance, nor meditate or relax. Never  drink, never do anything that might cause any sort of deviation from the norm.  Never watch movies, never fall in love. Nothing.</em>

<em>-It's  a choice between living and dying, the AI said, and he understood.</em>

<p align="center">***</p>
The ship destroys every pirate it finds at  the location, and its sensors pick up a trail. The Sister in charge, the same  one who recruited him, is very pleased. "It's not always that we find  it," she says, "and even then, we have no idea whether it'll lead us  to the right spot."

They move on.

<p align="center">***</p>
<em>-</em> <em>There is a chance you might live  longer. The six to eighteen months is a mean time; there is nothing except the  basic laws of probability that says you couldn't live a full life.</em>

<em>He  thought about this.</em>

<em>- So  I might die in ten years? he asked.</em>

<em>-  Yes.</em>

<em>- Or  I might die tomorrow, he said.</em>

<em>-  Yes.</em>

<em>The  AI watched him for a moment, then said, but chances are it will be within a  year and a half.</em>

<em>He  didn't ask how many had lived past that. He didn't want to know</em>.

<p align="center">***</p>
They've been through two more encounters.  At least they've been lucky enough to find trails leading them deeper in. The  Sister told him that sometimes the trail would grow cold and they'd have to go  back to square one.

They're chatting busily while strapped into  their seats, waiting for the pilot to finish off the last pirate. Remaining  unfettered in the middle of combat is just asking for a broken neck. The crew  members to either side of him are arguing about whether this is the second or  third encounter, one claiming that the first one shouldn't count, the other  that it should. It's an utterly pointless argument, and he understands it so  well. Anything to keep their minds off the fact that they could die at any  moment, either burned to a crisp or flash-frozen in space, their eyes bursting  out of their heads.

There is a resounding boom as the last  pirate is blown to shreds, then silence.

Speakers crackle. "This is it, folks.  We've found the trail again, and this time it looks like the mother lode."

With bated breaths, they course toward  their fate.

<p align="center">***</p>
<em>And  then, with no forewarning, he started to laugh.</em>

<em>The  AI was flummoxed.</em>

<em>- Do  you need me to turn off for a moment?</em>

<em>- No,  he said, still laughing.</em>

<em>He knew  it wasn't shock, at least not completely. It was acceptance, and it had hit him  like a hammer.</em>

<em>- Everything  is clear now, he said. All the rules have been changed. The grand joke has come  to its punchline at last.</em>

<em>The  AI remained silent, though he didn't know if it was out of respect for the  dead, or merely because it had no routines to deal with this sort of reaction.</em>

<em>- Everything  is clear, he repeated. I only had one relative, you know.</em>

<em>- I  know, said the AI.</em>

<em>- My  grandmother. She died last year. I always admired her strength, her will to  live in the moment, the simplicity she saw in things. I always tried to pare  down my life to match that, cutting away the complexities. But that's just not  something you can do. You can't ignore everything and force yourself to think  simple.</em>

<em>He  was babbling now, but he couldn't imagine stopping.</em>

<em>- True  simplicity and purity of purpose comes only when you've faced all the  complexities, and lived through them long enough</em> <em>– and deep enough</em> <em>– that you come through them, as if breaking through a barrier, and  right out the other side.</em>

<em>- And  you've broken through a barrier? the AI asked.</em>

<em>- I  have now. You achieve simplicity not by keeping complexity away, but by  embracing it, gladly giving yourself over to the torrents of life, and,  laughing, realizing that it's all insignificant and that it holds no power over  you, that life is one big joke with our death as the punchline and that no  matter whether you find the joke funny or not it'll still be spoken right to  the end, and </em>that<em> is the heart of humour and joy</em>.

<em>He  stopped, almost gasping for breath. The AI stared at him.</em>

<em>-  Would you like some pamphlets? it said at last.</em>

<p align="center">***</p>
"Deploy! Deploy! Go, go, go!"

They pour out, like blood spurting from a  wound. Drones whizz past them in a battle frenzy. The pilot is keeping the  pirates busy, keeping all attention focused on him.

They were all hand-picked by Sisters  operatives. Every one of them immediately zeroes in on the same broken-down  husk. It looks the same as the myriad other wrecks floating about, but they  know better.

He's the first to reach it. It wouldn't  show up on any scanner, that much is certain. It's a spherical thing, purple  and opaque like the marble he saw, and surprisingly inert. Even when it's  unconnected to anything, it doesn't seem to want to move. It takes three of  them to pry it loose, and when they do, it feels like taking a splinter out of  bare skin, like removing a thorn from the Lord's eye.

The sphere calls to him, but the happiness  it promises is laced with confusion, and he senses undercurrents of doubt and  madness. He ignores its call the best he can, and focuses on getting the thing  back to the ship. The Sisters have told him that the sphere will be purified.

Instinctively, he knows that the item's  placement here was intended to call hapless travelers, make this place into a  death trap. But there's more at play than that. It feels like they've stumbled  onto a dark tapestry, and managed to cut away one of the threads.

He looks at his hands. They're shaking from  the strain of removing the sphere. And they feel a part of him now.

Inside his suit, he smiles.

<p align="center">***</p>
<em>He  accepted the pamphlets with good grace, got up, and walked quietly out of the  office, heading towards his life.</em>
