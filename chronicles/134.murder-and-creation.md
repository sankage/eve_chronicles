# Murder and Creation

</p>
<p>Antel falls down in the mud again. It's been raining 
for days in the forge, and the long slog from his quarters to the iron works is 
tiring his feet and chilling him to the bone. He hauls himself up to his knees 
and rests for a while before standing up. He's so tired these days, but his 
sense of purpose is unflagging and it's not long before he's on his way to work 
again.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This life fills a void in him, as it does with so many 
of the other Caldari here. They are working for the State and serving their 
purpose in bringing it to greatness. It is his job to do his part. Most people 
have the same attitude, though some find it harder going than others.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He has never given much thought to how this void was 
created, or how it might otherwise be filled. It's there, and the harder he 
focuses on serving the State, the less he feels its presence. This is where he 
is, and this is where he'll always be. He can only change reality in some small 
measure, through diligent work, but he can change his perception of the entire 
world, and he chooses to serve.</p>
<p>
</p>
He only wishes he wasn't always so tired.

<p>
</p>
<p>The rain drives down. Antel overhears some people 
muttering about cold air and bad heating and the broken-down railway line that 
should've been fixed like so much else in this place, but he tunes it out.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A loudspeaker sounds as he approaches the factory 
grounds, blaring out his group code. He approaches a guard and asks what he 
should do, and the guard tells him that there was a mine crash in the night. 
They need people to clear out the rubble and anything else left inside. Antel 
has a lot of experience with this particular mine. He worked it for years, him 
and his friends.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With a sick feeling in his stomach, he heads over to 
the mine and meets up with those still living. They're given excavation tools 
and measuring equipment, and told to run checks on the infrastructure.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They proceed into the mine, which has been shored up. 
They find it in better shape than expected. Explorers are working in pairs, and 
Antel works alongside Foraani, a dependable man he's known for years. They know 
each other and the mine so well that they can move in silence, placing markers 
and inspecting fixtures with ease.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The mine is in decent shape, but the body they find is 
not. It has been crushed so thoroughly by a falling girder that there is little 
recognizable left of it except the head, which lies a little to the side. It 
seems almost untouched above the neck, something that strikes Antel as grotesque 
for a reason he cannot explain.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They peer closer and find that they recognize the 
face; it is an old friend from their shared time in the mining days, a man who 
never quite managed to get promoted out into the open air. Antel goes utterly 
cold. Foraani turns very white but says nothing, either, though he starts 
nodding to himself. He keeps doing it, even as they clear out the room and keep 
inspecting the mine, and when they emerge at last, he is still nodding almost 
imperceptively, and wringing his hands. They go their separate ways without 
speaking.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antel is told to take the rest of the day off. He 
obeys, and takes the long walk back to his living quarters, where he returns to 
his bunker, files a work report, then removes his work clothes and puts them in 
the cleaning bag. He takes a shower to get rid of the smell, puts on fresh work 
clothes and goes out behind the bunker, staring hard at the grey, muddy ground 
and breathing deep. He closes his eyes, is seized by vertigo, and opens them 
again, still staring at the ground. It's like clay, and the pink flesh of his 
hands stands out in contrast. He feels outside of himself and, for the first 
time, feels like he belongs to something he is no longer a part of, like his 
friend's head, untouched but without a body, staring in blankness at the grey 
ceiling above.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Night. It takes him a long time to fall asleep. He 
feels that he should be mourning his friend, but for some reason he cannot. It 
takes him a considerable amount of time to come to the conclusion that he no 
longer views himself or anyone around him as an individual, but merely as a bolt 
in a ship, a cell in a body, a wheat stalk in a field.</p>
<p>
</p>
It has been a long time since he last saw a field.

<p>
</p>
<p>When there is acceptance of one's fate, and of one's 
place in the body politic, one finds peace. One does not mourn the loss of 
another cell, because it means the body is renewing itself, cleansing itself.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At last he sleeps, finding solace in dreams about the 
past.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At work there is little talk, though in sequestered 
corners people are discussing yesterday's tragedy and others like it. Antel 
hears one say this is the last thing they're going to take, and hears another 
tell him that he needs to wait a little, that they've got plans. When he tries 
to listen in, they move away. The ironworks belch black plumes of smoke into the 
sky, turning it a little more grey. It has stopped raining.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He feels completely isolated. He is a Caldari first 
and everything else second, but he cannot stop seeing his friend's face. He 
hasn't eaten a proper meal in so long that he's no longer sure such a thing even 
exists. Nobody buys Gallente luxuries anymore, and they're not available on the 
market anyway, not for people like him. There is nothing to do but walk through 
the day like a cell flowing through the body, doing what needs to be done, and 
fulfilling its purpose.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At one point Foraani comes up to him, still as grey as 
the metal sky. He explains to Antel that something is going to happen and asks 
if he wants to join. He adds that the others don't trust Antel, but he's known 
him for years and years and knows he will not let down the cause, and that after 
everything that's been done to them in all that time, he cannot imagine Antel 
can go on anymore like this.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antel asks if their lost friend caused this, and 
Foraani says that he did; the company should have taken more security measures, 
and their entire attitude in this has opened his eyes to how thoroughly everyone 
is being abused. Antel asks Foraani whether he does not want to serve the State 
any longer, and Foraani says all he knows is how to serve, but a worthy cause 
needs worthy masters. He asks Antel whether he will join them, and Antel says 
that he needs time to think about it. Foraani looks at him for a long while, 
then nods once, says that he has less time to think than he realizes, and 
leaves.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The next night he lies awake again, feeling the panic 
rise in him like the tide, ebbing and swelling. There is going to be a 
revolution. There is going to be a break. He is a cell turning cancerous. There 
will be a revolution. He is a cell. He doesn't understand how a cell can 
consciously rebel against the body.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At last he gets up, calmly walks out and behind his 
bunker, barely catching a glimpse of the grey ground before his pink face opens 
its mouth and the pink contents of his stomach erupt from his pink body and 
splatter on the ground. He dry heaves a few times more, then spits off the 
strands of saliva and walks unsteadily back into his bunker, to sleep. He dreams 
about the future, and continually wakes up in cold sweats. He knows that 
something has gone wrong with him, but doesn't know what, or whether it was 
wrong all along.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>The last time he wakes is an hour before reveille. He 
lies in his bunk, his thoughts flowing past as intangible and unstoppable as a 
rushing river. There is a void in him now and the thoughts pour into it, 
circling it like a funnel and hammering at all sides, hollowing it out even 
further. He had tried to fill it with his love for the Caldari and his servitude 
for the State, but now it seems bottomless, unyielding and hungry for something 
else. He is here - he will always be here - but he no longer knows with 
certainty if his place truly is here, though he has no idea where else it should 
be. Even if he transfers his allegiances to another cause, thereby betraying 
everything else he stood for, he doesn't know whether it will fill him up any 
better than before. He wonders whether a cell can switch bodies mid-stream 
without self-destructing in the process.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It occurs to him that most of the effort is on his 
side, has always been on his side, and that sometimes you can put in so much 
effort that you effectively become what you're trying to uphold, giving yourself 
to it as if the cell had become the body.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>His stomach hurts. He rises and walks to the window. 
It's not grey outside, but orange; the sun is rising and the industrial works 
are bronze-colored with its light.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Anyone who tells on a coworker will be rewarded. 
Rebellions are crushed mercilessly. Those who attempt them are not true Caldari, 
Antel has taught himself, but traitors who want to ruin everything the State has 
built.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antel cannot help but wonder how it would feel to be 
the body and not merely a cell; to be the field growing slowly in the orange 
sun.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He goes to work. At some point during the day, he 
meets up with Foraani and tells him he'll take part in the rebellion. He swears 
a simple oath, for everything is simple in this place.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Night again, and he sleeps soundly. He dreams about 
the present, about the sun on the fields below; about floating away happy as a 
cell carried by the torrents in a body of his own making. When he awakes, he 
feels light, for the first time in years, as if the wind could blow him away.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He wakes up a betrayer, and heads out to work. On his 
way to the forge he deviates from course and eventually finds himself outside a 
guard's cabin. He stands in front of it, his eyes closed, head tilted up towards 
the sky. He realizes that anything beyond himself is no longer part of him; it 
is the body's to think about, and not the cell's purpose to question. So he can 
go into the cabin, or he can move on, a betrayer either way.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And in that moment it <i>hits</i> him with a force so 
hard that he is brought to his knees: he has a choice in this, he is in a 
current of his own making, and whatever he does truly will affect only him, in 
his own cell, in this body that by extension is his, too. Nothing matters beyond 
that context. He is going to betray something, and in doing so he is going to 
rise beyond the cell, acknowledge his own endless efforts, and at last become 
the body proper.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He walks into the cabin and tells the guard all about 
the secret plan. The guard listens intently all the while, saying nothing. When 
Antel stops speaking, the guard tells him that there are more people who knew 
about this plan than Antel realizes. Then the guard pulls out a gun and points 
it at Antel.</p>
<p>
</p>
He is in the field. He is here at last.

<p>
</p>
<p>The guard says something, but Antel is too busy 
smiling to hear him. He has become the body.</p>
<p>
</p>
The sun shines bright.

<p>
</p>
He is free.
