# The Speakers of Truth

![The Speakers of Truth](images/SpeakersOfTruth.jpg)

The Amarrian order that calls itself the  Speakers of Truth harks back to the Time of Contemplation.

It was a quiet period in Amarrian history.  The Holders had gained power but had yet to start their expansionist Reclaiming  in earnest; instead, they were focused on solidifying their powerbase. The  appearance of the first Emperors was a big help in that respect, since it gave  the Holders the opportunity to rule the masses by proxy and not have to risk  their own necks in the process.

However, the Holders decided that a trap  door was needed, an emergency option for them to wield executive power should  the Emperor grow too powerful too quickly. To maintain the appearance of  neutrality, they set up this power through a separate institution known as the  Speakers of Truth. This institution was a religious order staffed with hand-picked  theologians that were known not only to be favourable to the people's cause  rather than to the Emperor and the royal family, but also to be thoughtful, kind,  intelligent individuals who had more interest in improving the lives of their fellow  men rather than engage in the dirty games of politics. In short, the kind of  people who wouldn't be any trouble.

The order wasn't publicized in any manner,  and was buried beneath rules, regulations and religious red tape so as to hide  its true nature from the Emperor and his cohorts. Its only distinguishable purpose  was to act as intermediaries in religious disputes should the need arise - in  which capacity their word would be equal to that of even the Emperor himself - and  to recoup its operational costs by operating as an educational establishment  for selected Holder students. The latter aspect was intended so that the  Speakers of Truth would not appear to be overtly political, and thus would not  attract undue attention. The Holders then intended for the Speakers of Truth to  be brought out in circumstances where they needed to counteract or even veto a  decision made by the ruling Emperor. As it turns out, these circumstances never  arose, and the order was eventually forgotten by most of the ruling body.

The order took on its own quiet life, and ticked  along in peace. They were situated in a remote location, the better to avoid  getting involved in politics, and for the most part could operate without  interference. Aside from their hidden purpose of judgment, the Speakers of  Truth offered the usual aspects of religious life: They studied natural  science, led a self-sustaining life, and even offered temporary sanctuary to refugees  and those in need.

In fact, the order's controlling body  quickly realized that the best way to ensure the order's survival would not be  to try and eliminate the political trap doors the Holders had built for it -  the moment they'd start making waves, the order would immediately be dissolved  - but to use their talents to insert itself in Holder society, digging in to  such an extent that it would be unthinkable to remove them. Therefore, the  Speakers of Truth concentrated on building a reputation as an outstanding  educational establishment, offering both a private curriculum for select  children of Holders and a free education program for those children of  Commoners who showed promise. The Holder program gained them obvious popularity  with the ruling classes, and eventually led to strong backing by those who had  graduated from the Speakers' schools and risen to high public office. The  Commoner program, meanwhile, had a strong focus on religious studies, making it  all the more popular among the lower orders within the Holders, who embraced  any societal function that served to keep the Commoners obeyant and faithful.

The tactic worked. By the time of the Moral  Reform, the order was regarded as a minor building block in Amarrian high  society: a respected and respectable institution that exuded a mix of piety and  academia. In addition, they were seen as strictly apolitical, to the point  where they were sometimes even asked to perform their original arbitrative duty,  albeit in a far lesser capacity than intended. Ordained members of the Speakers  of Truth have divine permission to act as arbitrators in disputes both  religious and secular. While they have free rein to dispense whatever judgment  they see fit, the bulk of laws which surround their order sometimes makes this a  little difficult. As a result, their authority tends to be accepted by the  involved parties as an item of faith rather than on a strictly legal basis. The  order was subsumed into the Theology Council during the latter's rise to  position as main authority on religious trials and punishment, but due to the  Speakers' educational focus, they've managed to continue operating as a  separate unit, and the Theology Council rarely calls upon them to perform  duties of the court.

Of course, given that the Speakers of Truth  are sometimes asked to rule in matters involving high-ranking Holders, their  power does rankle some of the Amarr elite. The Privy council, composed of the  five royal Heirs, has always treated the Speakers of Truth as a minor thorn in both  their sides, but have never found enough reason to act against the order. There  exists a sort of unspoken agreement where the Speakers don't interfere with matters  that might have a political bent, and in turn are allowed to keep their  arbitrator powers unchallenged. Of course, there may crop up exceptional cases  in which the Theology and Privy councils will actually endorse the Speakers'  involvement in a political matter. One suspects that those cases will not bode  well for the defendant. Not well at all.
