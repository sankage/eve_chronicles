# The Dark End of Space

![The Dark End of Space](images/dark_end.jpg)


<p>Kezti Sundara, Grand Admiral of Amarr's Imperial Navy, 
stood alone inside the massive cathedral, dwarfed by the icons of eternity that 
glinted distantly in the lamplight. He remained utterly still, head leaned 
towards the vaulted ceiling. Quiet times were hard to come by in the Empire 
these days.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There was a metallic clank. Behind Sundara, on the 
other side of the cathedral, the massive doors slowly swung open. Footsteps 
echoed off the marble floor, then stopped.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Welcome, Captain," Sundara said without turning 
around.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Admiral," the Captain said.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Captain, why do you think you're here?" Sundara asked 
in a quiet but clear voice.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Tell me, sir," the Captain said in noncommittal 
tones.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sundara noticed the Captain's reticence. He turned and 
stared directly into the Captain's eyes. "We're going to war, Captain. 
Fulfilling our lives' purpose. Aren't you pleased?" he said, with the slightest 
hint of irony.</p>
<p>
</p>
"I really couldn't say, sir."

<p>
</p>
<p>The Admiral sighed. "Alright. Speak freely. It'll be 
the last time in a long while, so enjoy it while it lasts."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Captain made as if to speak, hesitated, and shut 
his mouth again. He broke the gaze and looked at the cathedral walls, whose 
tinted windows had changed hue and added a shining bronze to the evening's red 
rays. Eventually he said, "I don't think we can win this war. I don't even think 
there should be a war."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Recent events pass you by, Captain?" the Admiral 
said. "I hear we had some action. A bit of revolt, even."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Sir-"

<p>
</p>
<p>"The largest armada of Minmatar forces ever seen 
crosses over into our space, abducts millions of souls and causes untold 
destruction and havoc in the life of perfectly innocent people. The only thing 
that saves us right before the wave breaks is an intervention so definite and 
miraculous you could almost call it divine. And you, a leader of the Emperor's 
own holy fleet," the Admiral added, walking close enough to the Captain that 
their chests nearly met, "Don't think there should be a war."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This time the Captain held his gaze. "No, sir. I 
don't."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Explain yourself."

<p>
</p>
<p>"We're still reeling after the Minmatar onslaught. 
We're changing leaders, which always throws a spanner into the works-"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Master politico-theologians say we're experiencing a 
glorious sea change of unprecedented proportions, with nothing but celestial 
glory and heavenly fate that awaits us."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Theologians can suck my Apoc, sir. We're the ones 
manning the guns."</p>
<p>
</p>
Sundara betrayed a smile. "Alright. Carry on."

<p>
</p>
<p>"Look, sir, I'm as happy as the next man that Sarum is 
back in power. I honestly am. But we're a sea of people, vast and heavy. She'll 
need time to route everyone to her cause, even the ones who believe in it. And 
if the Reclaiming is to restart in earnest, we'll need to do it properly right 
from the start. The effort won't allow anything less than a unified front, a 
genuinely unified one; not just the sycophants and paranoia of Karsoth's old 
court. We need to clean house before we move into anyone else's."</p>
<p>
</p>
"You've given this some thought, Captain."

<p>
</p>
<p>"Well, my superiors insist on adding complexities to 
my job, sir. I'm merely trying to adapt."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Grand Admiral thought this over. He was sitting in 
a very comfortable chair, considering very unpleasant things. His Captain stood 
before him, a small figure in a vast and well-lit room. They were in a penthouse 
within shouting distance of the Crystal Boulevard. Lower military orders were 
ensconced in bunkers beneath the Boulevard's translucent shields, but the 
Admiral refused to let himself be cowed into those. Besides, in his career he'd 
attended many long meetings in close quarters with overexcited navy brass, and 
he knew exactly what it would be like. People thought better, up here in the 
fresh air.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Complexities such as?"

<p>
</p>
The Captain took a deep breath.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Aside from the time we need to sort out internal 
chaos, the external situation is so fragile that we can barely do anything at 
all. You can't sneeze in Luminaire without both our side and theirs locking and 
loading. If we fire even one volley ... well, their captains might have sense to 
hold back, but CONCORD will roar right in and stomp around, getting everyone 
excited, and sooner or later some idiot hotshot will see his path to glory. 
Everything gets set off, and all that's left of every planet in Luminaire is a 
series of smoking craters."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Duly noted, Captain," the Admiral said. "We can't 
start another war in Luminaire, which burns some of our hawks no end. And we 
certainly can't ignore or withdraw from CONCORD unless we want to supercharge 
the current chaos. What else?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Captain, staring straight forward, kept a 
carefully blank expression. "There is something else, sir?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Captain, we just lost an entire planet to a madman. 
You've served under me for years. This is no time for doubts or secret thoughts. 
What else? And stand at ease, for goodness' sake."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Captain maintained her stance but her voice 
softened somewhat. She said, "Sir ... what are we going to do about the 
capsuleers?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Anteson Ranchel, who had been Vice Admiral of the 
Gallente Federation Navy right up until the point his predecessor made one of 
the biggest military blunders in Federation history, gave his best Captain a big 
grin. "Well now," he said, "That's a bit of a problem. A group of people so 
powerful they're practically a faction unto themselves. Immortal, fearless and 
wealthy beyond imagining. Born of all four empires but beholden, in truth, to no 
one but themselves. And utterly untapped, in this little skirmish of ours."</p>
<p>
</p>
"We need them, sir."

<p>
</p>
<p>"Of course we do, Captain. They'll turn the tide of 
the war. Every capsuleer worth their pod should be taking a stand right now, and 
helping the forces of right against the tyranny and violence that envelops us."</p>
<p>
</p>
The Captain nodded.

<p>
</p>
<p>"And where, might I ask," the Admiral continued, 
"should that stand be taken?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"A long way from here, if it were up to me, sir," the 
Captain said. "Last thing we need is opposing forces of pod pilots shooting at 
each other right outside our planet."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Admiral smiled. "Good. I'm glad I've got some 
people left with more brains than bravery. So where, Captain, do you suggest we 
put them?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
"The dark end of space, ma'am."

<p>
</p>
<p>"If that's a euphemism, Captain," the Grand Admiral 
said, "Believe me, I've heard enough of them already."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For a Minmatar war room, it made a number of 
concessions to sanity. There were only two persons there, not several 
representatives arguing about policy or sharpening their weapons. The walls had 
tactical maps on them, not tribe banners, and the surfaces of the recon tables 
were completely free of small arms, painblades and replica Khuumaks.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Long meetings, ma'am?"

<p>
</p>
<p>"If I ever see another member of the Minmatar 
government, whether Republic or Nation, it'll be an eon too soon, Captain. Might 
end up putting them the same place you're suggesting we put our capsuleers. 
Sounds like a rotten use of good people, though."</p>
<p>
</p>
"The government?"

<p>
</p>
"The capsuleers."

<p>
</p>
<p>"Not really, ma'am," the Captain said. "We need the 
lowsec territories. We need the resources there for anything and everything 
we'll be doing elsewhere."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Admiral resumed her pacing around the room. Voices 
could be heard from somewhere far outside, either arguments or chants; it was 
hard to tell which, sometimes. "I don't like this, Captain. We did a full 
frontal attack and it was one of the most glorious moments in Minmatar history. 
We beat the Amarr nearly to a pulp, we flexed our might like never before since 
the great revolution. And we freed millions."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Yes, sir. We beat the Amarr nearly to a pulp."

<p>
</p>
"Captain-"

<p>
</p>
<p>"Up until the point where they burnt us to cinders and 
brushed away what was left of the ashes."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Admiral rubbed her eyes. Her name was Kasora Neko, 
she was in charge of the Minmatar Fleet and she had not slept for a long time. 
"Captain, I've had three meetings today with various Minmatar political 
officials who think that brandishing a Khuumak gives them free rein with war 
metaphors. I value your services, but understand that if you start the same, I 
will turn your innards into poetry."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Ma'am."

<p>
</p>
<p>"As it happens, I agree with you. I think we do need 
the capsuleers, more than many people realize. I think they're going to turn the 
tide of the war. I think they're going to <i>be</i> the war, in all honesty. 
There is no way we can get away twice with the stunt we pulled at Halturzhan, 
which means we'll need resources for a longer-term war, and we'll need to move 
around CONCORD. That means lowsec, and the only people crazy enough to fight to 
the death to hold those territories are the capsuleers. And that's not all. You 
know what's the most valuable resource in lowsec, Captain?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Well, there's Omber, and Noxcium, and probably 
Hemorph-"</p>
<p>
</p>
"It's people."

<p>
</p>
"Right."

<p>
</p>
"You're going to ask me what they refine to, Captain."

<p>
</p>
<p>"The thought did cross my mind, ma'am, but you've had 
a long day."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"We need them for our efforts. And the Amarr want them 
for whatever hellish plans they're cooking up. The Empire fleets won't dare come 
into our territory again, not when they don't know what we're capable of, and 
not while they're sorting out their problems. So this Reclaiming," she spat the 
word, "or whatever they want to call their excuse for today's dose of misery, is 
going to start in lowsec, where we've got millions of people we can't possibly 
defend."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
"And it goes beyond that, Captain."

<p>
</p>
<p>The Captain was silent. His superior had not asked him 
a question.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"We've only just begun," the Admiral continued. The 
garden was quiet apart from the bubble of the sand waterfall and the distant 
whispers of the laser birds. "This first achievement is one of many to follow, 
so long as we can keep everything together on the home front."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Captain looked to the birds. Hearing his Admiral, 
who had served in the Caldari Navy for a long while, criticize the State's 
infrastructure like this set his nerves on edge. There'd been enough instability 
already without the high powers consistently making it worse by acknowledging 
it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"What do you think about going into lowsec, Captain?" 
the Admiral asked. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Captain cleared his throat. Fleet Admiral Morda 
Engsten was an intimidating presence, and when she asked a question like that, 
she wanted a good answer.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Well, ma'am ..." The birds were approaching, their 
halogen outlines flickering in the sunny air.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Admiral sat down near the sand waterfall. "Speak, 
Captain," she said, not unkindly.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I think it's an excellent idea whose implications are 
sure to be vast, ma'am."</p>
<p>
</p>
"You think it's dumb."

<p>
</p>
"Like a rock, ma'am."

<p>
</p>
<p>Engsten reached out and put her hand into the 
waterfall, palm upwards, fingers spread out. The sand flowed around them 
unrestrained. "Tell me more, Captain. You're not going to ruin anything, least 
of all your own career."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Captain allowed himself to doubt this. 
Nonetheless, he had been asked a question, and he admired the Admiral. He took a 
deep breath. "I don't understand why we're going into low security space, sir. 
It feels like we're running away. Say what you wish about Heth's rise to power, 
he lined us up at last, and made us kick hard at the Gallente. We've got Caldari 
Prime back, which I didn't think would happen in my lifetime if it ever did at 
all. We've got a war <i>here</i>, Admiral."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"That we do, Captain," Engsten said. "Now tell me what 
gains we're fighting for."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Well, our people have been oppr-"

<p>
</p>
<p>"The gains, Captain," the Admiral interrupted. "Not 
the ideology. I want our final military goal."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Captain began, "Well, there is Luminai-...", then 
caught the Admiral's gaze and fell silent. He thought for a while, then said in 
quieter tones, "We're not talking about Luminaire, are we, ma'am?"</p>
<p>
</p>
The Admiral slowly shook her head.

<p>
</p>
"Ma'am ... we're taking this all the way, aren't we?"

<p>
</p>
The Admiral nodded without smiling.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Luminaire is a bomb right now, one that could be set 
off by anything and which nobody can control." It felt like he was mindreading 
the entire military council in absentia. "So we go into lowsec space to test out 
our capsuleers and build up resources. And as we make those gains, we also gain 
territory. Gallente lowsec territory. Which brings us closer to Gallente highsec 
space."</p>
<p>
</p>
"And Luminaire at last," Admiral Engsten said.

<p>
</p>
<p>"And Luminaire at last, ma'am," the Captain said, a 
slight tremor in his voice. "Along with everything else. We'll take their edges, 
and then there'll be nothing left but the center. We'll do it, Admiral."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Fleet Admiral put her hand in the sand again. "And 
there is no doubt in your mind that we can do this?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Of course not. We're Caldari. And we're in the 
right."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Admiral smiled. The sand hissed as it flowed 
through her fingers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Aside from the hiss, the room was entirely silent. The 
five Jovians inside sat and stared into the ether. They were surrounded by 
polycarbonate windows that showed the starry space outside.</p>
<p>
</p>
The hiss came from an open comms line.

<p>
</p>
The Jovians waited.

<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In four different elevators on four different 
stations, two diplomats got in on the top floor. One, who represented an Empire 
Faction, took out from his pocket a small datapadand cracked a joke about wars. 
The other, who represented CONCORD, accepted the datapad, signed it with his 
identity key, and laughed at the joke.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The elevator ride was long and the diplomats spoke 
swiftly, coding and signing the necessary digital back-and-forth with practiced 
hands. By the time they got out, the four empires had petitioned CONCORD to 
ratify an emergency capsuleer militia procedure, and were now officially at war.</p>
