"But no one's gonna come down on me for this, right?"

<p>
</p>
<p>"Don't worry about a thing. The agency will cover your 
back legally, we'll assign a pseudonym, you'll be absolutely fine."</p>

<p>

</p>
"Yeah. I just need to be sure there's absolutely no…"

<p>
</p>
"Mr. Sitsui. Remember what we talked about."

<p>
</p>
<p>"I know, I know." The young man tugged absently at the 
dark tin figure-eight woven through both nostrils. The sight of his skin 
stretching made her nauseous.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Okay," she said, with more finality than she felt. 
She fixed her gaze on the table between them. "Whenever you're ready, go ahead 
and start from the beginning. If you want to reword something, just stop and say 
'I'd like to reword, please.' If you aren't sure you're remembering something 
correctly, it's very important that you mention that, even though you're going 
to give us the events as they transpired to the best of your recollection. All 
clear?"</p>
<p>
</p>
"Yeah."

<p>
</p>
"Okay."

<p>
</p>
<p>She leaned back in her chair and briefly thought about 
lighting a cigarette, then decided against it.
Better to let them ease into it on their own. Wait until they find their feet in 
the story, then light the torch as a sign that everyone's at ease.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Okay. So we're sitting there, there's about four of 
us..."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Wait. Start by telling me a bit about who you are. 
Sorry."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Oh. Okay. I'm Orin Sitsui. I'm, uh, I'm a materials 
tech for Caldari Constructions, here under service contract with Kaalakiota 
Second Command, currently on eighth year of service."</p>
<p>
</p>
"All right, that's good. Thanks."

<p>
</p>
<p>"Sure. So, yeah. Four of us, I think maybe five, but 
I'm pretty sure four."</p>
<p>
</p>
"This was where?"

<p>
</p>
<p>"In my section. The east ridge, level 55. My hab was 
in a real sweet spot, right next to the Syntact galleries and a row of 
restaurants. A small group of us who'd been in training together, we used to 
always hang out there. And this time that I'm talking about – we're all pretty 
new, you know, and most of us have never been exposed to how strict the 
regulations really are up here. I mean, we were told in training but I guess 
they didn't do a good enough job of hammering it in or something, because almost 
everyone I knew would have a story within like a week. One guy got trapped in 
the laundry room after hours and had to be rescued by maintenance drones. One 
guy wore a wristpiece that covered up a part of his ID derm and got zapped by 
his own doorway. Everybody was adjusting, you know?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She nodded, bunching up her toes inside her shoes. 
That cigarette was calling her.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"So, right. We're sitting in one of the places near my 
hab on a Wednesday afternoon, and we've just finished a long bout of shifts so 
we're looking at four days off. We're drinking, you know, getting fast on cheap 
stimstickers – yeah, legal ones, of <i>course</i> – and just having a good time, 
and then there's a commotion. Turns out there's a capsuleer coming through. Now, 
this was before the big boom, so eggers were ultra-rare. None of us had ever 
laid eyes on one.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Turned out there wasn't much to see. He was really 
short. Dark hair, nondescript face. Civire, I'm pretty sure. He had a contingent 
of Home Guard guys with him, real nasty pieces of work. You constantly heard 
about the Home Guard guys on the station. Infantry grunts, right? Signed up for 
war. Getting put on space station guard duty, for these guys, was like being 
told to cook and eat your own face. One of the guys in our section had a brother 
who was a Home Guard recruiter, and he said the guys who got assigned to the 
space stations were all being punished for insubordination, even if they did end 
up leading squadrons of the contract grunts. He said they joked that being a 
Station Sergeant was a demotion from Private.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I really should have known better, I guess. Should 
have, I don't know, I should have put two and two together. But whatever."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She took the cigarette case from her pocket and nimbly 
fished one out, then placed it between her lips and lit it. Distantly he stared 
at the cherry of her flame for a few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Would you like to take a break?" she said. "There's 
no rush. If this is hard for you to tell, we can wait a bit." She blew a column 
of smoke into the air-conditioned swirl above them. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Nah," he said, leaning back in the chair and putting 
his hands on his knees. "Nah, I'm fine." He resumed his story.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"So I'm quite lifted, you know? I got four days off, 
I'm getting pretty loose off the stim-alcohol mix, and Janeira's on the other 
side of the table giving me all the right signals. And at one point I look over, 
and I make eye contact with one of the Home Guard guys.</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>"This guy had the weirdest look. He was staring right 
at me when I looked over, but still it felt like he couldn't see me somehow. At 
first I thought it was 'cause of my skin, since there aren't many halfbreeds 
like me running around on the upper decks. But then I realized it was because of 
the way I was sitting. I was sitting on the back of my chair with my feet on the 
seat, and station regs frown upon that, you see. I felt ridiculous suddenly, 
like a kid in a lunchroom who was about to catch a whack from the minder. And, I 
don't know, maybe that was exactly what made me do it, but out of nowhere I 
looked back at him and then pursed my lips in a little kiss.</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>"And just as I do it his eyes sort of widen a little 
bit, and Janeira notices me doing it and looks back, and when she sees who I 
just did it to she goes into this barely-subdued fit of laughter, and then the 
other people at the table catch on, and all the while the guy's just standing 
there, glaring back at me with the meanest god damn expression you ever saw. I 
felt this weird combination of fear and elation, like I was playing this danger 
game and it could go either way, you know, and I think I acted it too. But it 
was all for show, really. As soon as I made that air-kiss, something deep inside 
of me just went 'oh man, you did it now,' and this creeping sense of dread set 
in.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"So after staring at me for a few more seconds the guy 
breaks his gaze and goes back to looking around, guarding the egger guy, and the 
egger by this point is talking with another guy who's arrived at the table. 
Things are quiet for a few minutes, and I kind of stop worrying about that glare 
and start thinking I lucked out, you know, got away with it. And then suddenly 
there's this mad shuffle of movement, and the egger stands up and kind of 
stumbles back, and the guy he was talking to is just kind of sitting in his 
chair shaking, and something black and round falls from his hand, under the 
table.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Took me a while to notice that the grunt who'd been 
staring at me was holding out a little pistol-shaped thing in the guy's 
direction. He had this intense look of concentration on his face, but hateful 
too, like he was gonna end this guy right then and there. A couple of seconds 
pass and the guy's just sitting there, jiggling and foaming at the mouth, and 
all the grunts are just kind of staring, and I mean, us too, everybody in there 
is just staring at this guy get slowly roasted.</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>"Then all of a sudden the soldier stops and the guy 
just slumps forward on the table. The Home Guard guys go into this big huffing 
kind of secure-the-perimeter dance and one of them leads the egger away. We're 
just sitting there slack-jawed, looking at the whole thing unfold, right? And 
then I notice that, sure enough, the one who'd been staring at me is making a 
beeline for our table, and my feeling of dread just comes powering back. We're 
all kind of rattled by the scene, so as he approaches we're sort of 
half-standing up. My friend was about to say something to him, but he just walks 
right up to me and grabs my arm. He's pretty flustered, like he doesn't know 
himself exactly what he's gonna do next, but there's this anger in his eyes, 
this absolute insane rage, you know?</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>"So he grabs my arm and I instinctively resist, right? 
I don't know what he wants with me, so I kinda pull my arm back and it makes him 
lose his balance momentarily. I start to say something, but just as I'm starting 
the sentence he whirls around and just smacks – he's carrying this compact 
bullpup piece with a chromed handle-end , right, and he just smacks it right 
into the bridge of my nose.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Now, I'm no fighter. I grew up in a KK creche, never 
been in a scrap in my life, never had much interest in any of the fighting 
sports. So I guess up until that moment I had a pretty dim idea of what could 
happen and how bad it could be. Man, it was <i>bad</i>. First thing, my eyes 
just open up. I mean a full force torrent. I couldn't see anything. There was 
this disgusting crack, and I fell back down on the chair with this slick heat 
spreading all over my mouth and down my neck. I wanted to say or do something, 
but I was way too shocked to do anything but sit there and blink and sputter.</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>"Jaseira told me later that the guy took another look 
at everyone around the table, just sort of coldly took stock of the situation 
and then decided it was well within bounds to do it again, so he did. Twice. The 
second one made me black out, thankfully."</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>She regarded him with what she hoped was a 
compassionate look. He was tugging at his nose contraption again.</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>"I was too scared to register a complaint but I found 
out a couple days later that Jaseira had gone and done it anyway, behind my 
back. She was way more angry about the whole thing than I was. I guess maybe she 
felt partly responsible because she'd laughed at the guy too. </p>

<p>

</p>
<p>"Anyway, we never saw him again. I got some kind of 
standardized letter of apology from their station commander a couple weeks 
later, but it didn't say anything about what they'd done with him or whether 
they'd even done anything at all."</p>

<p>

</p>
"You're positive it was him?" she asked.


<p>

</p>
<p>"Yeah. I wouldn't have called you guys otherwise. I'm 
not stupid. I know things have a way of getting out despite best intentions, and 
I know this isn't gonna make me very popular with the guy or his cronies. I just 
need the money. I'm splitting."</p>
<p>
</p>
"A few of you are, huh?"

<p>
</p>
<p>"Yeah. Just doesn't feel right around here anymore. I 
mean, we worked for the glory of the State before there was a big man at the 
top. We worked for the State because of what it represents. And there's one guy 
up there now with everything under his heel.
What happened to the needs of the many outweighing the gains of the one? I mean, 
I like what he's doing, some of it anyway. The mood here is more optimstic than 
I've ever seen it, and there's this really strong sense of purpose, but I just, 
I don't know. I guess I got my reservations about what kind of foundation it's 
all built on."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Where are you gonna go?"

<p>
</p>
<p>"I'd rather not talk about that, if it's all the 
same." He looked at her for a few seconds, then gave a rueful little half-smile.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Okay," she said, giving the signal for the recorder 
to be shut off. "Okay, well, I think we have everything we need. Your 
compensation should be in your account already. Thanks for your candor, Mr. 
Sitsui."</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>It was evening in the office-box of Executive Editor 
Harben Mullar, and outside its two small windows the studio assistants were 
busily disassembling the day's sets, tools whizzing and clicking under the 
artificial light. She was standing in front of his desk. Her finished piece was 
lying upon it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"The story was corroborated by three of the four other 
witnesses. The girl has been relocated to a different part of the region. I 
wasn't able to get a hold of her."</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>Mullar didn't look at her. He drummed his fingers on 
the table. "Okay," he said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Sitsui himself says he doesn't think the attack was 
racially motivated, but I think the story will speak for itself."</p>

<p>

</p>
"Uh-huh."


<p>

</p>
<p>"It's funny. He has this ancient reconstructive 
wire-mesh thing in his nose. Vherokior tech from hundreds of years back. I asked 
him why he didn't just get it regrown. Said he needed the reminder to not do 
stupid things. All very dramatic."</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>Mullar nodded. <i>Bi-di-dim,bi-di-dim,</i> went his 
fingers on the table.</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>"Everything checks out. Heth was with the Home Guard 
at the time, and he'd been assigned to the station in question just three weeks 
earlier. He was dismissed four months after the incident. The official reason 
was budget cuts, but this wasn't an isolated incident and I doubt his superiors 
could ignore that type of thing for very long."</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>Mullar ceased his tapping and leaned back in his 
chair. He sighed. "I know it all checks out," he said. "It's a good piece, 
Rekka." </p>

<p>

</p>
<p>His tone had a terribly familiar ring to it. She 
looked at him for a long while. </p>
<p>
</p>
"No way, Harb," she began.

<p>

</p>
<p>"Yup. Just got a call from Agency Central. They're 
redlighting the piece."</p>
<p>
</p>
"No <i>way</i>, Harb," she said.


<p>

</p>
<p>"Yup. Indefinite standby. Directive came from right up 
top."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"But it's a good piece. It's inbounds. It's not a 
bullet." Her voice was rising. "I thought we agreed,
we're just illustrating… "</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"<i>We</i> agreed, Rekka, but you know as well as I do 
that if AC decides we can't run it, then we can't run it. It's out of my hands."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Did they give a reason, at least? Or is it the usual 
need-to-know bullshit?"</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>Mullar fished a cigarette out of his case. "Take 
tomorrow off," he said, screwing it between his lips. "There'll be time to talk 
after the weekend."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She stood there, staring at him. For a while she 
stared, as he clicked open a small lighter and briefly bathed the end of his 
cigarette in blue flame.
He looked at her with resigned firmness and blew a plume of smoke into the space 
between them. </p>

<p>

</p>
She turned on her heel and walked out.


<p>

</p>
<p>The door shut on the office of Harben Mullar, and as 
it did the studio's lights winked out, one by one by one.</p>
