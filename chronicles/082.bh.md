		Keying in the ignition sequence, Hammerhead softly whispered a quick prayer.
		For a few glorious seconds the Oscillator Capacitor Unit hummed to life.
	</p>
	<p>
		It all went downhill from there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suddenly a groaning sound struck his eardrums. Sighing, he moved closer to the
		generator in search of the sound's origin.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Damn this infernal machine!" he growled. Apparently the generator was
		producing the sound. Probably not getting enough power. Then, a high pitched
		whine followed by a grinding sound which came to a crescendo and stopped
		abruptly. With all these faults, he thought to himself, the Secure Commerce
		Commission will never approve of this as a trade commodity. The scene vanished
		as he turned off the simulation and reached for his pack of smokes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hammerhead gazed over at his ever-growing inbox while he sparked up. "Star
		gates offline in Pator, Faulty sentry gun code through Arida, Camera Drones
		flaking out... it never ends," he mused as the smoke from his cigarette drifted
		into the air.
	</p>
	<p>
		Trying to get back on track, he brought up the simulation once more. As he was
		again running his investigation into why the component constantly broke down at
		2500 GHz he thought to himself, "I wonder if I can fit one of these on my
		Heron... sure would make traveling in less scrupulous areas safer." Focusing on
		his diagnostic read-outs, he just couldn't understand why the component wasn't
		receiving enough power. All previous tests had looked promising.
	</p>
	<p>
		He decided to call it a day on the analysis - after all, there were plenty of
		other projects to be getting on with. For one, he still had to finish the new
		neural connector user interface along with his colleague Tom.
	</p>
	<p>
		Hammerhead dealt with many branches of CONCORD in his day-to-day duties. The
		Secure Commerce Commission, like many other CONCORD branches, was rife with red
		tape and bureaucracy, and extremely stringent when it came to authorizing new
		products as official trade commodities. With such restrictions on the way
		products were released, he had to stick to a strict timeline that told him when
		such products could be out on the street.
	</p>
	<p>
		He opened a sub-space comms channel with Traveler and waited for the
		transmission to go through.
	</p>
	<p>
		"What's the word, Hammer? Do we have a winner?" Traveler was a Research and
		Development agent at Ishukone who was doing work on various projects for
		pilots. Hammerhead liked working with the R&amp;D agents. They always had new toys
		for him to play with and they were never in much of a hurry due to the fact
		they got paid by the hour.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Sorry, Traveler. I've been running some more simulations and the results just
		aren't coming back like I hoped. I expect this project to take at least another
		three solar cycles. The parameters are just wrong and the power supplement is
		fluctuating continuously instead of streaming smoothly," Hammerhead replied
		with a sigh.
	</p>
	<p>
		"While I've got you on the line, I think I've figured out a way to enhance
		Particle Accelerator efficiency by 20%, but I'm going to need your help getting
		the SCC to categorize them as marketable."
	</p>
	<p>
		Hammer sighed to himself and lit another cigarette. It was Monday morning, the
		start of what looked to be another very long week.
