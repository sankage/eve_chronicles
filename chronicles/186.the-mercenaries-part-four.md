# The Mercenaries (Part Four)

<p>
"Hello Garmasi. I hear you like getting people in trouble."</p>
<p>
The Amarrian whose name had been spoken slowly put the 
merchandise back on the vendor's display bench, and stood up straight. His 
wrinkled features coagulated into a smile.</p>
<p>
To the voice behind his right ear he said, "Depends on who 
deserves it. How did you get out?"</p>
<p>
The voice said, "We had some help. Amazing what people will 
descend to doing, just for their own personal interest."</p>
<p>
"Isn't it just?" Garmasi said. "But if you don't mind me 
asking, what makes you think that coming here, out in the open, is going to do 
you any good? Do you perhaps have a laser knife on your person?"</p>
<p>
"None such," the voice said.</p>
<p>
"A small gun, silenced or perhaps pressurized, and loaded 
with change-state ammo? Something to really put me in my place, during those 
last few agonizing seconds of my life?"</p>
<p>
"Not at all."</p>
<p>
"Disintegrating garrote," he said. "At least that. To lure me 
into a dark alley and snap on that self-tightening noose that does the job for 
you."</p>
<p>
"Nothing of the sort."</p>
<p>
Garmasi turned and faced her. "So what exactly is to prevent 
me from calling the guards and having your"-he looked her over-"admittedly 
marvelous figure thrown right back in jail, now on suspicion of disorderly 
conduct, kidnapping <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">and</i> jailbreak?"</p>
<p>
"Oh, I don't think you want to do that," Joreena said. "But I 
do think you want to tell me about your plans."</p>
<p>
"I do?" Garmasi said with a smirk. From his seat behind the 
display board the vendor coughed politely, for the pair was blocking sight to 
his merchandise, but neither one of them moved. When he coughed again, the 
Amarrian turned to him and in one swift motion pulled out a datacard, keyed in a 
number, touched the card to the vendor's scanner, plunged the card back in his 
pocket and hit the scanner's confirmation pad with a fist. A series of digits 
scrolled up on its screen. The vendor promptly shut up.</p>
<p>
"You do," Joreena said. "You had us arrested on small 
charges, but you've been hanging out here with not a worry in the world. You 
must have figured we'd be coming after you and messing up your business."</p>
<p>
"Not really, dear," Garmasi said. "We have no real business 
here other than to protect our client. As for you coming after us, one of our 
guys knows a thing or two about Gurista datasystems. I'm afraid we gave you a 
rather ugly past. Nothing worthy of a capital offence, but certainly enough to 
have you retained while the authorities figure out what to do with creatures 
like you."</p>
<p>
"Creatures like us?"</p>
<p>
He shrugged and smiled. "Fires. Children. You're bad people."</p>
<p>
Joreena stared at him for a moment, then smiled and seemed to 
make up her mind about something. "So we'll disappear. Strike at you from the 
shadows. And we will get our target."</p>
<p>
"You'll do nothing of the sort," Garmasi said. He stepped in 
and took firm hold of Joreena's upper arm, turned his head and said to the 
vendor, "Triple the amount I gave you if you get the guards here right now."</p>
<p>
The vendor nodded eagerly and moved his hand underneath his 
stall. There was a clanging noise, and suddenly guards were all over the place.</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid this is the end, my dear," he said.</p>
<p>
"Yes. It is," she said.</p>
<p>
The guards moved in.</p>
<p>
"It's a shame you didn't have any other purpose here. We 
might have come to some kind of arrangement," she said.</p>
<p>
"Oh, it's far too late for that now," he said.</p>
<p>
"Certainly," she replied, quite sanguine.</p>
<p>
He furrowed his brows, but didn't have time to say anything 
else, for a muscular hand was clamped on his shoulder. "Alright, murderer. Time 
to go."</p>
<p>
He looked around. A large Guristas guard stood there, backed 
by five others. Two of them already had their stun batons out.</p>
<p>
Garmasi stammered out "Wait, what-" before the guard holding 
him pulled back a fist and punched him in the stomach. "Shut up, asshole," the 
guard said as the Amarrian doubled up.</p>
<p>
Joreena knelt beside him. "Save your breath," she said. 
"You'll need it for the interrogation. I hear it's a little harsh for someone of 
your reputation."</p>
<p>
Garmasi's eyes bulged at her.</p>
<p>
"You're <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">bad people</i> now," she whispered and blew him a kiss before the guards dragged him 
away.</p>

***</p>
<p>
The good thing about doing your own crazy science experiments 
in warehouses and empty rooms across the universe was that you learned to 
recognize the signs. Artenal approached the building, taking his time and 
looking closely at its doors and windows.</p>
<p>
There wouldn't be a risk of explosives or other 
area-of-effect damage from this guy. Drones meant accuracy and clean hands. That 
suited Artenal fine. He wanted to get dirty.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, drones could also mean early warning 
systems, and fighting conducted from a distance. Artenal walked very slowly and 
used his eye for patterns. Nothing beeped, and nothing blinked, and it seemed 
like his opponent hadn't rigged up anything at all. It was understandable – the 
man was leaving soon and his enemies were supposed to be rotting in prison – but 
very stupid. It was assumptions like this that got a person hurt.</p>
<p>
Artenal grinned, and patted the small sphere in his pocket.</p>
<p>
The warehouse door was creaky, but a gearhead always carried 
some kind of oil. He made his way deeper into the building.</p>
<p>
Inside, its periphery was dotted with all manner of debris 
and junk - mostly skeletons of hover vehicles that had been scrounged for every 
useable part - but the center was an open area that had been cleared out. In it, 
by a metal workbench, sat the Gallente man Artenal had seen at the bar, quietly 
tinkering with something. The high roof and bare walls caused every metallic 
click from the Gallentean's tools to echo.</p>
<p>
"Safety's the illusion of the unprepared, Ontre," Artenal 
said, stepping out from cover. Ontre looked up and regarded him for a moment 
before bowing back to his work.</p>
<p>
When there was no further reaction, Artenal walked a few 
steps closer. He was too far from the Gallente mercenary to see what he was 
working on, other than a pile of silvery mechanics and a mess of wires, but 
close enough that he could see several small attack drones lying neatly sorted 
on the edge of the bench.</p>
<p>
"Are you going to turn those on?" Artenal said, with perfect 
calm.</p>
<p>
Ontre stopped his task and for the first time seemed to 
properly register Artenal's presence, looking at him with quiet interest. 
"Should I?" he said.</p>
<p>
"It's either that or you surrender and come have an 
unpleasant conversation with me and some friends of mine."</p>
<p>
Ontre seemed to honestly consider this for a moment. Then he 
shrugged, said, "I do have a lot of work to do here, you know," and reached out 
for a switch on a small activation board lying on the bench.</p>
<p>
The air was filled with an angry buzz as the drones came to 
life. Ontre adjusted a few settings on the board, then leaned on one elbow and 
watched Artenal.</p>
<p>
It took a few seconds for the electric machines to rise in 
the air and orient themselves. They hovered ever higher, adjusting their 
formations and apparently communicating with other. Despite himself, Artenal was 
fascinated. "Do they always take this long to get into gear?" he asked. "If I 
had a gun you'd be dead by now."</p>
<p>
"They go from zero to kill in point eight five seconds per 
meter in mid-air, assuming no wind. There're some emergency features, too, that 
let them launch themselves up or even directly at someone. Total from offline to 
guaranteed impact is one point one two, with my hand on the activation trigger," 
the Gallentean said. "And if you'd had a gun you would've shot me at range, so I 
figured I might as well let them go through the whole syncing routine. They get 
a little grumpy if I use them too much with realignment."</p>
<p>
"Let's see what they can do, then," Artenal said and started 
walking towards the mercenary. The drones, who were floating in the rafters by 
now, immediately turned their electric eyes to him. There was an echo of a dozen 
little prods extending from their carapaces, followed by the crackle of 
electricity.</p>
<p>
As Ontre shrugged and flicked another switch on his control 
board, Artenal reached into his pocket and pulled out the EMP bomb. The drones 
roared downwards, electric oblivion aimed at Artenal, and it took more 
self-control than he'd expected not to run. He clicked on the bomb and tossed in 
the air.</p>
<p>
There was a whomph, and the drones clattered lifelessly onto 
the ground along with the spent bomb.</p>
<p>
Ontre frowned. Instead of reacting to Artenal's approaching 
presence, he looked back to his work and prodded it a few times with a 
screwdriver. "You just cost me a full day of very complex work," he said.</p>
<p>
"Shame. Maybe next time you'll know better than to mess with 
us," Artenal said. He was closing in on the Gallentean and had started to reach 
out a hand that he expected would grab the man by his neck, when the mercenary 
ducked, shot in and clamped his arms around Artenal's knees, tripping him up. 
Ontre immediately followed through, resting one knee on Artenal's sternum and 
pinning him, the other leg stretched out for ballast, and started raining 
punches on his head.</p>
<p>
The shock of the attack cost Artenal several valuable 
seconds, and his vision had begun to blur at the edges when his brain caught up 
with what his body was undergoing. He bucked his hip, then dropped it again and 
rolled away, getting to his knees. As the Gallentean rushed towards him, he 
pulled his small steel blade out of a hidden part on his belt and held it behind 
his hands, feigning wooziness. The mercenary aimed a kick at his head, and as it 
curved close Artenal swiped his knife at the leg. He'd been hoping to hit a 
tendon, but the blade buried itself midway into Ontre's calf, and the kick hit 
the side of his head with lessened force that was nonetheless enough to nearly 
knock him out.</p>
<p>
Ontre dropped to the floor, screaming. He tried pulling out 
the knife, but its notched edge wouldn't budge. By the time he had the sense to 
look up again, Artenal's other hidden knife slid neatly under his chin and into 
his head.</p>
<p>
Ontre slumped, lifeless.</p>
<p>
Artenal sat there for a long time, reflecting on career 
choices, and on the idiocy of assumptions.</p>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center">
***</p>
<p>
It was dark and the alley was deep, but he had been told she 
would be here. He knew she wouldn't be, at least not unprepared and certainly 
not by herself, but that was all right; he'd made preparations of his own.</p>
<p>
Kralean walked about slowly, listening for noise and for 
silence.</p>
<p>
"Hello, weakling," a voice said.</p>
<p>
He turned. A woman of Minmatar origin entered the mouth of 
the alley. She wasn't dressed in much, and the distant lights of neon and stars 
made her dark skin glisten, highlighting its tattoos and scars. Kralean saw the 
cut of her muscles, which writhed like coiled snakes, insinuating themselves in 
effortless motion. It was the woman from the bar, but he hadn't paid any 
attention to her back then.</p>
<p>
She was followed by a dozen people, all of whom looked like 
they came from the darkest part of space.</p>
<p>
"Word has it you've been going after my associates. Got free 
somehow, think you're gonna be real clever and take us out. I tried contacting 
them, thought it was just the usual Guristas shit station service. Turns out it's 
you, and that you've turned the guards against us."</p>
<p>
"That would be Artenal. He figured you'd be easier dealt with 
if we imposed a blackout. Sorry about the inconvenience," Kralean said and put 
his hands in his pockets. The Minmatar woman's associates tensed up, so Kralean 
added, "I'm not pulling a gun. Relax."</p>
<p>
"So I let word spread that I'm panicking," the Minmatar woman 
said, "And set up a meeting with an escape contact. Lo and behold, you show up. 
Where are your pals?"</p>
<p>
"I honestly have no idea," Kralean said. "I explicitly 
requested that I get you to myself, and I see I made the right choice."</p>
<p>
The Minmatar woman frowned. She turned to one of her 
associates and said, "Kill him."</p>
<p>
The man nodded and wordlessly started making his way into the 
alley. When he'd covered half the distance, Kralean pulled out of his pocket a 
small item and said, "Come any closer and I'll press it."</p>
<p>
Everyone froze in place. In calm and very clear tones, the 
woman said. "What is it you have there?"</p>
<p>
"Oh, it's just a button," Kralean said, and pressed it. To 
his great enjoyment, everyone but him pinched their eyes shut for a second, then 
looked around in amazement. "Told you," he said.</p>
<p>
"Great Tribe of earth and sky," the Minmatar woman said in 
exasperation, sighing with spent adrenaline. "<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kill him</i>!"</p>
<p>
Her man moved in. Kralean smiled. There was a brief scuffle.</p>
<p>
After the man's body had stopped twitching, Kralean dusted 
off his robes and said, "Look, maybe we can work this out."</p>
<p>
The Minmatar woman and her people stared at the broken form 
lying by Kralean's legs. She said, "What ... what do you suggest?"</p>
<p>
"Well, you've got a tiny golden Khuumak hanging around your 
neck. I like those, they're cute. Break it off and toss it to me, and I'll give 
you a running start."</p>
<p>
Even at this distance he could see her face tense up and her 
jaw clench. "Don't forget to recite the names of the Emperors," he added. "You 
must've been taught them at some point."</p>
<p>
She looked directly into his eyes and said in a dead voice, 
"You will never walk out of this alley alive." She started walking towards him, 
her team in tow.</p>
<p>
He gave a brief smile and cocked his head, as if listening, 
then looked towards the sky.</p>
<p>
Had this been a mere alley fight, he thought, she would have 
continued. But even despite her visible rage she stopped, and told her men to 
stop as well.</p>
<p>
He found himself relieved that he'd secured backup. The 
transmitter in his pocket felt far too light, but he pressed it again, sending 
the second and final message.</p>
<p>
"Why are we waiting?" one of them said, in the plaintive 
tones of a child being told it can't play with its favorite toy. "He's just 
standing there."</p>
<p>
"Yeah," she said. "That's the problem. What are you listening 
for, preacher man?"</p>
<p>
"The people," he said. "And I think they're arriving."</p>
<p>
There was a susurrus in the air. Kralean said, "You know, 
most people had the sense not to help you out. The ones who did sign up in your 
little crew are the ones that everybody else on this station positively hates 
and fears. But there's strength in numbers."</p>
<p>
"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>
"There's a lot of faith in a place like this," he said. "And 
it took quite a bit of convincing, but I've been a Wanderer for the Speakers of 
Truth for a long time, and I know what to tell the people who want to hear, and 
how to listen to those who otherwise never get to speak."</p>
<p>
The susurrus turned into a tremor. The mercenaries looked 
around and saw groups of people pouring into the alley.</p>
<p>
"You really should have listened," Kralean said before the 
beatings began.</p>

<p>
Shahoun moved through the darkening night, alone and 
unprotected.</p>
<p>
The last of his team had vanished. They'd been heading 
towards the docking area when his Caldari bodyguard stopped them, saying he'd 
heard a noise. The guard had ordered him to stay put, then gone off to 
investigate and never come back. He'd heard a woman's laughter in the distance 
and it had given him the shivers. He ran.</p>
<p>
Now he was at the docks, moments away from his ship. Nothing 
mattered but to get away.</p>
<p>
The customs agent took a long time looking over his data. 
Then he said to Shahoun, "I'm sorry, sir. Your ship has been sequestered."</p>
<p>
He did not even bother arguing. "Is there any way I can get 
off this station? Any way at all? Please?"</p>
<p>
The customs agent looked at him for far too long.</p>
<p>
"Look," Shahoun said, "I'm very sorry if I'm being too 
forward here. I don't mean to imply anything about you, your job or personal 
ethics. But I absolutely positively have to get somewhere very soon, and I'll do 
anything I can to make it happen. Please. I'm begging you."</p>
<p>
 The agent kept looking. Then at last he said, "Well, sir, 
your ship has been seized but you're under no official obligation to stay, 
though I don't doubt you will be once investigations have run their course. But 
I can see you're in dire straits, and I'm willing to consider a compromise."</p>
<p>
"Name it. Anything," Shahoun said.</p>
<p>
"There's a ship leaving soon, and I know someone on it. Spoke 
to him earlier tonight, as a matter of fact. They've finished their business 
here and have plenty of room for passengers. I'm sure you could bargain with 
them to get you where you want. They're good people."</p>
<p>
"Thank you, please. Yes. That would be most wonderful."</p>
<p>
The customs agent handed him a card. "So if you'll just make 
a quick donation to the customs agent retirement fund, I'm sure we can sort you 
out."</p>
<p>
"Of course, of course," Shahoun said and grinned. "How much?"</p>
<p>
"How much is it worth to you?" the customs agent said without 
expression.</p>
<p>
Shahoun signed off an amount, and the agent looked it over 
and nodded. "Section 34C, red area, sir. Move quickly, now."</p>
<p>
"Thank you so much," Shahoun said and ran off.</p>
<p>
He made it to the ship on time, was waved through by another 
customs agent without a word, and went into one of its waiting chambers, where 
he sat down with a heavy sigh of relief. He didn't want to talk to anyone just 
yet, merely to be whisked away into the oblivion of deep space.</p>
<p>
After not too long the outside door closed automatically. The 
only other door was the one that lead deeper into the ship, standing ajar.</p>
<p>
There was a tink from that door. Shahoun looked up and saw a 
big, burly Minmatar man smiling at him, a small canister in one hand. The man 
threw the canister at Shahoun, who instinctively grabbed it.</p>
<p>
"Welcome onboard," Artenal said and shut the door. The 
canister started hissing, and let out a white non-odorous gas that filled the 
room.</p>
<p>
Shahoun's felt inertia pull hard on him, though through the 
increasing fuzziness of his thoughtweb he didn't know whether the ship was 
taking off or if he was merely losing his consciousness. It felt oddly 
relieving.</p>
<p>
His last thoughts before passing out was that he really 
should have hired these people instead.</p>
