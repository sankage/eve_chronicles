# Extinction Burst

<p>
        The type of behavior that presents the greatest potential for scientific study, 
        I find, is that which is exhibited under duress. Not enough research has been 
        undertaken in this area, and those who engage in it do so under a dark cloud of 
        superstition and mistrust, suffering a woeful lack of support from the public. 
        We have to do it all ourselves – all of it – hidden away like criminals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Against completely nonsensical prejudices, I should add, held by a species 
        composed almost solely of unexamined habits and chiseled thoughts, a species 
        whose worldview has been set since childhood, with room for nothing new or 
        exciting, and to whom the suggestion that there might be something worthwhile to 
        be found on the edges is so repulsive as to be anathema to the trembling cores 
        of their very moral fiber.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take the extinction burst, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
        While most people – including a few scientists, even – believe that certain 
        behavioral patterns cannot be forcibly deteriorated, I am of the opinion that we 
        simply have not developed the correct methodology. Everything can eventually be 
        exposed; expulsed; exterminated. But lifelong habits run deep, and the 
        development of an all-encompassing methodological framework that can 
        demonstrably break even the most stringent of these remains, unfortunately, 
        beyond my abilities. I'm still fencing with the problem; working on the edges, 
        trying to find a way in.

        An extinction burst is not the extinction of a species, though that would be a 
        marvel to engineer. It has to do with the more granular exhibition of learned 
        behavior, when that behavior is met by adverse conditions never before 
        experienced, and with the reactions subsequently exhibited by the afflicted 
        organism. In most cases these new conditions progressively alter and eliminate 
        that behavioral pattern, but you'd be amazed at how desperately some animals 
        will maintain their old habits before finally letting them die off for good.</p>
    <p>
 This is, quite honestly, a good thing for evolution. I have no time for a species 
        that gives up the first time it encounters failure, or pain, or lack of reward.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some species do give up right away. But others will persist, following through 
        on the same pattern even when it is not being rewarded, or even, I should say, 
        when the situation might demand that they break the habit. They may no longer be 
        safe. There may be a dearth of food, or water, or air. They may be running out 
        of time. But still they'll cling on to what might be called, for the lack of a 
        better term, hope. Moreover, their attempts will intensify, the number of 
        attempts rapidly increasing for a short period of time in a last-gasp attempt to 
        maintain the pattern. That is the extinction burst.
    </p>
    <p>
        We see this occur in various guises throughout the animal kingdom, but it has 
        not been extensively studied. This lack of research surprised me when I first 
        began looking into the phenomenon; I did not expect my experiments to be 
        groundbreaking merely by dint of being the first ones performed in a proper, 
        thorough, scientific manner. Naturally, I've tried to cast a wide net, acquiring 
        a set of vastly unlike species in New Eden and, under controlled conditions, 
        carefully noting their reactions to my stimuli.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most learned patterns have to do with confinement, but I've never been entirely 
        comfortable with the usual button-stimulus paradigm. All it really does is 
        produce a lot of needy, overweight rodents.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead – and believe me, this took a bit of time – I've set up a kind of 
        working, monitored environment. Not just a cage with a bed and a feeder, but an 
        actual maze of sorts. It's complete with all manner of stimulus-providing 
        machinery, most of which remains hidden until the animal makes its way down that 
        particular corridor or into that particular room. The function of the stimulus 
        machinery is basic and easily understood by whatever animal I've got in the maze 
        - often no more than the familiar button or sensory panel dispensing a quick 
        drink of water or a brief encouragement of some gland or another. It does not 
        constitute the main experiment, but it's extremely handy for taking more 
        detailed measurements of the subjects' current extinction burst status.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main experiment is the maze itself. Most of the corridors and rooms have 
        exits, but they are hidden and will reveal themselves only after a specific 
        sequence of events has been enacted. Again, these events are not too complex for 
        most of the animals in the maze, though I will admit that I was rather 
        disappointed initially by the Hanging Long-Limbs, - but they do require the 
        subject to experiment rigorously with materials at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        The maze starts off easy but gets progressively more difficult. Along the way, 
        as noted, stimulus-providing machinery permits me to monitor the subjects' 
        extinction progress. Some tend to give up quite a bit sooner than others, and 
        every time they stop to push a button in a room, you can see the hopelessness in 
        their increasingly lackluster reactions to the stimuli.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Hanging Long-Limbs, of course, remain the exception.
    </p>
    <p>
        When animals come to in my maze – I'll admit I have to sedate them for transport 
        and preparation, but it wears off without any noticeable effect – they tend to 
        pace about a bit, get familiar with their surroundings, and altogether look a 
        little confused but inquisitive. Not quite so for the Hanging Long-Limb. I don't 
        quite know what causes this.
    </p>
    <p>
        The species has quite a limited spread, confined as it is to the methane clouds 
        of a single Gallente planet. It grew up in an environment that has remained 
        unchanged for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, almost entirely unspoiled by 
        man. It has its predators, as everything does, but it knows how to deal with 
        them, and nothing in my maze sets off any of its ingrained warning signals. The 
        Hanging Long-Limb is also not, I have to say, a very intelligent species. This 
        is not necessarily a drawback: Low intelligence often means highly developed 
        instincts and makes an animal's responses easier to predict, categorize and 
        quantify. Lastly, it does not rush into anything. It is a fast animal when it 
        wants to be, as various small amphibians have learned to their brief regret, but 
        unless driven by the impetus of moveable prey or by a nearby predator, it simply 
        is not in any great rush at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had not considered this when I acquired these animals for my maze. They were 
        costly – I had to flood the damn maze with methane, too – but they are worth it. 
        While other species all follow more or less the same behavioral patterns, the 
        Hanging Long-Limb continues to defy my expectations. It moves slowly, dazedly, 
        as if drugged, and it seems to take an endless fascination in studying its 
        surroundings. Many of them never even make it out of the first room. Watching 
        their progress, once the observer has cultivated the necessary patience, is so 
        lulling as to be practically meditative.
    </p>
    <p>
        The same cannot be said for another of my favorite subjects, the animal known to 
        its local population as a Charisoco. It is a small rodent, nimble but extremely 
        strong for its size, and restlessly inventive. It is invariably curious when it 
        begins to explore the maze, shuffling around the corridors with apparent 
        aimlessness, but even then, my observations have proven that it develops – 
        visually develops –- its escape methods by making its way through the twisty 
        corridors with remarkable alacrity. The first half of the maze provides little 
        to no obstacle to this ingenious little animal, which makes its tendencies to 
        halt its progress and experiment with the side-track stimuli I've left in 
        various rooms all the more amusing to monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, the great beast they call the Slaver – easily one of the most 
        dangerous animals I've put in the maze, and certainly one that made me nervous 
        to the point of queasiness when I first watched it wander the corridors – has a 
        more forthright approach. It is cunning, as predators are, but if it gets too 
        frustrated it will eventually begin throwing itself against the walls, 
        heedlessly ramming its bulk against them in a futile but impressive display of 
        strength that rattles the room. The Slaver is a harsh and brutal animal that 
        simply does not ever give up, though whether its tenacity is out of survival 
        instinct or a kind of angry desperation, I don't yet know.
    </p>
    <p>
        None of which helps prove the extinction burst, as these animals make their way 
        through my labyrinthine passages. At least, it remains unproven until they get 
        to a random room – I don't even know which one; my maze autoselects it – where 
        no solution will work. None. The exit strategy, which becomes obvious after a 
        little while, does not function. No matter which panels, buttons, floor plates, 
        or decorative items are touched, in whatever order, nothing happens.
    </p>
    <p>
        The real, proper exit strategy...well, that's when some of the animals start to 
        get a little nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've run this experiment countless times. I truly feel I am on the cusp of great 
        discoveries here. But moreover, I simply enjoy watching these animals, my 
        favorite subjects. I don't feel I'll ever tire of them, though I do fear that 
        some day I will inevitably grow weary of the experiments themselves, and I'll 
        have to put an end to it all. Yes, even the Hanging-Long Limb, reposed in 
        blissful quiet; or the creative little Charisoco; or the restless, pacing 
        Slaver.
    </p>
    <p>
        And maybe even you, my darling, as I watch you screaming at the walls.
