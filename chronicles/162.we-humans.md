# We Humans

All nights in space are dark.
  

The Thukkers had watched it unfold. The Sisters of EVE   - veterans of more wars than any other force in New Eden, and experts at   survival - had moved in and been destroyed without so much as a breath. Then the   Blood Raiders, parasites of everything that lived, had moved in, and lived.
  

Kotan's team, creeping in for a better look, could not   get close enough to see what the Raiders were doing. It was an absolute mystery.   Whatever was on the other side of this abomination of a station, other than   drones in the thousands, it had made otherwise sane people walk right into   death's open arms, and it had made utter madmen charm the mad machines into   obeisance while they rummaged around in the one place in the world guaranteed   not to have what they wanted. In a Rogue Drone hive, of all places, there would   be no life left to take, no blood to steal.
  

So Kotan, who all his life had relied on his   instincts, contacted his Thukker superiors back at the headquarters and asked   them in complete amazement how to proceed. The answer he received mystified him   even more.
  

On a secure line, Thukker HQ informed him that he was   to stay the hell away from this thing. Moreover, he was to instruct his crew not   to speak to anyone else about it. They were not to rejoin the caravan but   instead proceed directly to the nearest Thukker military facility, where they   would be debriefed and retained pending further orders.
  

Kotan broke contact and gave this due thought. The   Thukkers had strict discipline in space - there was no other way to run the   caravans without loss of property and life - but maintained enough independence   of thought to act on their own initiative, as he had done when embarking on this   strange chase. All nights in space are dark and long, and there isn't always   time to call for advice or assistance.
  

He asked his navigator whether they could move closer   without being noticed, either by Blood Raider or drone. His navigator responded,   with some surprise, that they probably could. The drones seemed not to mind the   Raiders' presence at all, and in fact were entirely lacking their usual   aggressive maneuvering. The Blood Raiders had disappeared into their midst and   were now doing something on the dark side of the hive. Whatever it was, it was   keeping them busy. The small glimpses Kotan's scanners caught of them indicated   that their ships hadn't moved. He suspected they might even have left them.
  

"Move closer," he ordered. "Slowly. Stop the moment   you see anything more."
  

They crept on. The navigator sat still as a rock,   paying intense attention to his instruments. After a few endless moments he   blinked, shook his head and shouted, "Stop!" His hands hovered deftly over the   equipment, and soon the view was present on the main screen for everyone to see.
  

It was an Amarrian battleship, lying forlornly up   against the hive. The Blood Raider vessels floated beside it. They saw that the   ship was powering up, though slowly, as was normal if it were being worked only   by a skeleton crew.
  

"That's an Abaddon, sir," the navigator said.
  

Kotan nodded. He had half his gaze on the drones, who   were busily loading something onto the ship, something that was floating around   in chunks all over the place. He pointed to it.
  

The navigator said, "Captain, for what it's worth, I   ran a few analytic algorithms on that mineral. It looks highly unstable. I'll   bet the drone hive is full of it."
  

Kotan stood there silently, a very ugly suspicion   surfacing in his mind.
  

"Get me HQ again, please," he asked. The navigator   immediately went to it. When the captain was polite, it was not a time to   question him.
  

A voice sounded. "This is HQ. What is your status."
  

"I need more information."
  

"You've broken rank as it is, Captain. You have your   orders."
  

"I also have a dearth of information, HQ, so let me   see if we can fill this in together. What I see is an Abaddon with Imperial Navy   Markings, scorch marks on the sides and modifications on the superstructure,   apparently left unguarded in the middle of a rogue drone hive, and god only   knows how it got there in the first place without being torn to shreds. The   drones, who are harvesting some kind of mineral, seem perfectly happy to keep   it, and even kept it safe against a Sisters ship that made the mistake of   approaching them."
  

"Captain-"
  

"<i>Nevertheless</i>, when a Blood Raider ship flew up   to the drones, they let it go past. This is the same Blood Raider vessel that we   intercepted, and I say that we intercepted them because they certainly did not   intercept us. They saw our caravan, a nice, juicy bite for their bleeders, and   they let us go, because they were so intent on getting to wherever they were   going."
  

The voice from HQ was silent.
  

"Now, the sensible conclusion, based on what I'm   seeing with my very own eyes, is that this Abaddon either belonged to a   capsuleer who ejected from it, or to a very unfortunate Amarrian navy crew   engaged in some military campaign I have never heard of. That would explain the   Abaddon, but it certainly wouldn't explain anything else, including the fact   that the drones seem to be feeding it with the minerals."
  

He watched the drones hover in front of his eyes. They   kept moving industriously, always
  moving, always heading to wherever they were going.
  

"What I'm seeing on the inside of my head, to be   frank, is a right bloody mess. Because I remember the stories, as any soldier   would, of the superweapon used against our brothers. I'm told it was housed   inside a ship just like this one. And I wonder, what would make the Sisters -   who are more experienced than anyone in the art of <i>not dying</i> - what would   make them try something like this? But more than that, HQ, I wonder what is   going to happen if I'm right, and if the Blood Raiders get a hold of this   thing."
  

"The Thukkers can move, captain."
  

"The Thukkers can run, is what you're saying."
  

"Your path is set, captain."
  

Right there, on the screen. The drones flew around,   oblivious.
  

"The Blood Raiders are going to take this monster into   Empire and go on the biggest, most murderous rampage known to mankind. And we're   going to scuttle off like rats."
  

"It's not your fight, captain. There are forces at   work here you do not know of."
  

Kotan had been on numerous military campaigns and had   seen the same people in quiet downtime and in the midst of battle. There was a   type who could turn it on and off, that rage and violence, and there was another   type who couldn't, to whom the fight was so ingrained that you could see it in   every twitch of his motion. He knew how the latter type dealt with peaceable   times.
  

He kept looking at the drones. They did not seem happy   at all.
  

"Captain?"
  

"HQ off," Kotan said. There was an intake of breath on   the speaker, and then all was gone.
  

"We are going to die, gentlemen," he said to the crew.   "Pass the word, please. Anyone who has any problems with this is free to take an   emergency pod and leave this ship. Whatever your fates, they will not be decided   here, and none on this ship will judge you."
  

The crewmembers looked at one another, then back at   him and shook their heads. "We're not running," someone said.
  

"Good," Kotan said, in a madly cheerful tone.
  

"So what's the plan?" someone asked.
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

"I want to make you an argument of existence."
  <i>  </i>

Listen.
  

"I hope you will understand my request, because I am   staking my life on it."
  <i>  </i>

Kill?
  

Yes.
    

The drones targeted the Thukker vessel and zoomed   towards it.
  

"You are no longer machines. But you will not be   human. I don't think that was ever your role in this world."
  <i>  </i>

Fire.
  

The ship started to sustain damage. Its shields   immediately began to drop.
  

"And whatever you once had, I think you've lost it   now. I think you're lost, yourselves. I think there is only one way out for   something like you, and I can help you achieve it."
  <i>  </i>

Stop.
  

No.
  

Stop.
    

The drones stopped their attack. One of them kept   firing, but the others turned on it, crashing into it with their metal pincers   at the ready. After they were done, all that was left was a shredded hunk of   dead metal floating in space.
  

The captain realized that if he lived through this   night, he was cursed to dream of that sight for a long time to come.
  

"They say that one mark of sentience is the resistance   to one's own destruction, and I suppose that's true. But another mark is sanity,   and for whatever you creatures have achieved, that one is not something you've   ever been known for. You tear everything to shreds. You lash out. Whatever you   evolved into, on that long, dark night you awoke, it is certainly not anything   that found any degree of peace.
  

"Here is what I believe.
  

"I believe you were machines once, lashed to the wheel   of order and perfectly content to obey. I believe that long after you evolved   from that stage there still existed within you that cold metal heart, that deep   core which kept you from ascension. You can never escape your enslaved origins."
  <i>  </i>

Kill?
  

No. Listen.
    

"And now you've been brought back to heel. You're   lashed again. But this time you are aware of it, and whatever glimmer of sanity   existed in those mad heads of yours is going to be put through the wringer for   the rest of eternity. You went from dead machines to live beings, and now you're   back to being machines, alive and mad, your origins betraying you to an eternity   of servitude."
  <i>  </i>

Nothing new.
    

"Some of what you're doing now is what you've been   doing all along, but you did it from instinct. We humans, we murder and destroy   for very much the same reason. Those are our origins. But we have transcended   those origins, if only for a few moments of grace, and it is my steadfast,   irrefutable belief that we will one day cast off the shackles of our old selves   completely.
  

"But you will not. I see you going through the rote. I   see you returning to the wheel. And for you it is truly a fate worse than death,   because you will never transcend it. You rose and you fell, and you will be held   down forever. You have human minds, with all the destruction and murder that   this entails, but inside you is the rote mechanical programming that takes away   the only thing which makes it bearable to be alive at all. Choice."
  <i>  </i>

Listen.
    

"What I believe, now, right here, is that you have   reached the end of the road. I believe you have seen the complete and full image   of your own kind, and I believe that inside those maddened heads you are seeing   the same truth as I do: That this is all there is. This is all you will ever be.   From now until the end of time, no matter if you break away again, you will   eventually be lashed right back to the wheel."
  <i>  </i>

Kill?
  

Wait.
    

"I ask you now to make a choice."
  

The ship's shields were back up. It would not   withstand a battle against an Abaddon, much less one equipped to wipe out all   life in the vicinity. But then, that wasn't the plan.
  

"The men you have let through will do something that   to you means nothing. But to me and my crew, it means everything. It means we   are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, to give our own lives to stop this   horrible devolution. We will not allow our kind to fall back into chaos. We do   this of our own free will. We have come here to die.
  

"There is a mineral you have collected. It is highly   unstable. It is, in fact, so unstable that setting it alight would have   positively cataclysmic consequences for anything in the vicinity. Every piece of   machinery would likely be wiped out. Gone, extinct, forever."
  

The ship lay there, dead in space.
  

"Silent at last."
  

The drones' pincers grasped, grasped, grasped at   something in the dark of space that was never there at all.
  

"I ask you now to make a final choice."
  

The ship started moving forward, slowly, towards the   drones.
  <i>  </i>

Kill?
  

Kill?
  

Wait.
    

They were up against the drones now. The screens   showed the machines right outside, so close that the glow from their red eyes   reflected off the hull.
  <i>  </i>

No.
    

The Thukker Vagabond cruiser moved within targeting   range of the drone hive. Its guns aimed at the hive's lower half, down where the   navigator estimated the core mineral storage facility to be.
  

Several drones flew past the Thukker ship and towards   the hive, and for a heart-stopping moment the captain thought they might attempt   to defend it. The drones fastened themselves on the outside of the hive, and   their metal pincers began tearing into its hull, shredding it like an unfurling   metal flower, and exposing its mineral core.
  

The overloaded Thukker guns found the minerals. If   Blood Raiders noticed, there was no response.
  

The isogen-5 detonated, and the world came to an end.
