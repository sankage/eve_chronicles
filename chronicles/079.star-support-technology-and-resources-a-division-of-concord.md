# STAR: Support, Technology and Resources	A Division of CONCORD

<p>I floated inside my capsule drowsily listening to the artificial hum of space.
	My STAR frigate, the ISD Banana was floating just outside the docking perimeter
	the University of Caille station in Bourynes, and I was bored.</p>
<p>After a while I became aware of the small flashing light that signified a new
	pilot entering the system. <i>"Hmm," </i>I pondered to myself <i>"could this be who
		I'm waiting for? Aha!"</i> I grinned triumphantly as the pilot's file
	appeared on my visual. <i>"Graduated this morning. Bingo!"</i> I then ordered
	my ship's CONCORD issue scanner to lock the pilots capsule signal, and then
	with a flip of a mental switch... space folded... and my frigate was floating
	in the University Training Grounds next to the Velator Frigate of a bemused
	looking young pilot whose image had just appeared on my visual.</p>
<p><i>"H..hi?"</i> stammered the pilot, <i>"what do you want? How did you do that?"</i>
	I smiled at the image and vocalized my reply. <i>"Hi there! I'm Captain Rhaegar of
		CONCORD's Interstellar Services Department. My division, Support, Technology
		and Resources, or STAR as we generally refer to it, is tasked with greeting
		pilots who have just received their Pilots License and helping them out if they
		have any problems. How are you finding solo flight so far?"</i> The young
	pilot looked relieved. <i>"I thought you might be a University official here to
		tell me I'd graduated by mistake,"</i> he grinned. <i>"I'm doing alright, but
		the training you get for the license doesn't cover half of what's really out
		here..."</i></p>
<p>And so went my morning. I would sit outside the various Universities, Academies
	and Schools and wait for new Pilots to appear, and then offer to help them find
	their feet. It had become clear some months earlier that the basic pilot
	training offered by the four empires was not really sufficient to cover the
	complexities of a pilot's every day life in New Eden, and so CONCORD had
	decided to put to use one of its divisions, STAR, which had previously been a
	kind of Citizen's Advice service. Equipped with state-of-the-art ships, which
	used a prototype jump engine they were able to travel the galaxy extremely
	quickly, so whenever a new player graduated, they could be there.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I received an urgent transmission from STAR headquarters in
	the Polaris system. <i>"We're getting reports of a huge jump gate malfunction in
		the Yulai system"</i> reported a Lieutenant, <i>"Looks like its gone out of
		synch, and none of the ships are completing their jumps!"</i> I sighed. It
	seemed like every time we updated the jump gate software to be more efficient,
	more gates would malfunction, stranding the pilots in a kind of stasis. The
	only way to solve the problem, save completely re-starting the gate, was to go
	to each ship individually and re-program its navigation computer to be in synch
	with the gate. It could take hours. Thankfully as I arrived in Yulai so did
	four other members of the team, and we set to work "freeing" the dozens of
	immobile pilots.</p>
<p>By the time I returned to STAR headquarters I was exhausted, but I still made
	time to check up on the galactic news before heading to my bed. After all, I
	had to help the citizens of that same galaxy tomorrow.</p>
