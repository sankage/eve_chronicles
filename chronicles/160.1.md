The Sisters reached the source of their quest, and   found it strange and frightening.
  

One of the navigators called the captain to the   bridge. "Sir," he said in a tone as coldly dead as a grinning midnight moon, "I   think you want to see this."
  

It was a gargantuan construct. It eclipsed the stars.   The captain had never seen anything like it in his life.
  

At some point there had been rock there, with shards   of unrefined ore poking through its surface like shards of bone from an open   break. The rock could still be glimpsed but was completely dwarfed by the   intricate architecture of metal and electronics, layers upon layers that   interweaved like the veins of a mechanical god, dead or dreaming. The human eye   could not possibly take in the entire sight at once, nor comprehend each of its   components: The nooks and crannies that were nonetheless large enough to house   entire battleships; the craggy spikes that jutted everywhere like antennas   listening for incomprehensible voices; the blocks that looked like half-built   housing for Titans; and the walls, on every side, with thousands and thousands   of glittering windows, glowing in the dark with the light of the vast   unknowable. It was a station of stations, a collation of superstructures that   seemed to constantly reach for the viewer's gaze.
  

The construct took the Sisters' speech away. And it   was only after they had caught their breath that they realized it was not dead.   Not moving, for movement implies life, but inhabited, possessed; and whatever   had claimed or made this monster was <i>writhing</i> all over it.
  

They were rogue drones: Mad, sentient machines as   close to alien life as New Eden had ever seen. They crawled over the surface of   the station in the hundreds, constantly mending and altering. As the captain   looked away, disgusted and awed in equal measure, he saw hundreds more, possibly   thousands, drifting in and out of the station's many openings, and even more   still flying to a nearby blue star.
  

A navigator said, "Sir, this is the source. That   signature we were after. It's here. That ... thing, it's full of it."
  

"Keep talking to me," the captain said. Everyone's   eyes were fixed on the terrible drones. "What are we looking for? I will not   believe it's the drones themselves."
  

The navigator, gratified to have something else to   focus on, got busy on his datatable. "Sir, the whole hive is a storehouse of a   material called isogen-5. It's remarkable, sir. Quite amazing."
  

"Tell me."
  

"The mineral is incredibly rare, sir. I've been   running scans for many years now, and I'm of course very familiar with all the   theoretical backgrounds, but I don't recall ever coming across one like this   before. According to our database, it's so rare that I doubt you or I or anyone   else would ever have seen it throughout all our lives if we hadn't been looking   for it."
  

"That rare, is it?"
  

"Sir, it was half believed to be only a theory until   this point. We know next to nothing about it except that it's incredibly   volatile and found only in the presence of Type O stars. Blue ones."
  

The captain looked at the star in the distance and   sighed. "No, someone else found it first, apparently."
  

"Who, sir?"
  

"Jamyl Sarum."
  

The captain tore his gaze away from his camera drone   screens and looked at the data the navigator had pulled up for him. The isogen-5   glowed bright as a furnace in the rogue drone hive, but there were little embers   of it floating around nearby. The drones were collecting it, he realized.
  

He had his attention redrawn to the drone hive. His   initial disgust was swiftly giving way to amazement and wonder. The drones were   picking up the isogen-5 like harvesters in a field, obeying some law of a nature   that was utterly alien to the Sisters. Even here, in this place of a strange and   mad new life, there was order and routine. The captain's confidence returned. He   and his team had been brought here, to see these sights, and to communicate with   these entities. In mutual humility and brotherhood.
  

"Sir, there is something else. It's only showing up on   our scanners because we know to look for it."
  

A tiny red dot hovered in the center of the screen,   somewhere in the mess of the hive. The crewman zoomed in, and zoomed again,   magnifying their view until the entire screen was filled with the glinting   surface of the hive wall.
  

The red dot became an outline. It was an Abaddon, an   Amarrian Battleship.
  

"It's on the other side of the station, sir. And it's   permanently cloaked, undoubtedly by some power source controlled by the drones.   I caught it because it contains a cache of isogen-5."
  

The captain opened his mouth to ask, but the answer   launched itself into his mind like a firework. The realization hit him so hard   that he had to grip the railing, his knuckles immediately turning white with the   effort.
  

"Sir? Are you all right."
  

He didn't dare believe it yet. It was there, but it   couldn't be there. "I want you to confirm a few things for me," he said,   enunciating each word with exquisite care. "First, the signature we've been   after all this time, the one we picked up from the EVE gate, matches the one in   our records of the cataclysmic battle during the battle between the Amarr Empire   and the invasion force from the Minmatar Republic."
  

"Sir-... well, yes."
  

"And from my own experimental data, available only to   the crew on this ship, this same signature then led me directly to the home   court of the Empress herself, and eventually to this place where we find an   Abaddon."
  

"Yes, sir."
  

"I want you to scan this ship. Any way you can. Tell   me if there is anything out of the ordinary with it, other than it being used as   a storehouse for isogen-5:"
  

The room was quiet. Everyone sensed that something was   happening.
  

After a good long while the crewmember said, "There   is, sir. I can't launch proper scan probes that'll get past the drones, but the   data seeping from the Abaddon's power systems and our lock on the isogen-5   signature allowed me to sketch out some parts of its interior."
  

"And?" the captain said.
  

"It's like no ship I've ever seen, sir. Whatever's   inside it, it's given over entirely to some vast mechanism that takes up a good   deal of the ship's interior and definitely involves the isogen-5. The ship's   forward superstructure also has several release points not usually found on   vessels of this design. Some kind of particle emitter technology that's been   rigged onto the mains. I can't explain their function except that they look like   hybridized conductors of some sort."
  

"And the isogen-5 is part of all this?"
  

"Sir, if I didn't know better, I'd say the isogen-5 is   being used as fuel for the whole clockwork. Or ammo."
  

The captain breathed deeply. His faith had been   rewarded.
  

This was it. The whole thing; the gun and the bullets.   The flame and the fuel. The fabled superweapon and the isogen-5.
  

It was everything they needed.
  

"Sir-"
  

He let go of the railing and took a deep breath. "Come   with me, Haatanen. And you, Jora, and Beteal."
  

Without so much as raising an eyebrow, the assistant   captain and two heads of navigation got up and followed the captain to a nearby   meeting room
  

The captain waited until they had all gone in and the   door had closed. They took their seats at a large table whose plate was of   opaque glass, as many holotables were. The captain called up a smaller version   of the main screen and had it projected up from the table. The Abaddon's red   outline hovered before the team's eyes.
  

"We have a choice here," the captain said. "I do not   believe it is any kind of choice at all, but every man needs to feel they're on   the given path of their own volition.
  

"On the other side of that hive is the superweapon   Jamyl Sarum used to repel the Minmatar invasion. It is the largest, most   powerful weapon the world has ever known."
  

He paused, surveying his people.
  

"I want it," he said.
  

They did not move to speak, which he took as a good   sign.
  

"We obviously need to get past the rogue drones to get   it. There is no way we can do this by force, not with our situation. The entire   unified power of the Sisters might do it, if we were lucky and deathless. More   likely we would need to pull in other allies, by which time we'd either be   enmeshed in an unsolvable diplomatic mess, or the weapon would simply be gone.   It got here somehow; presumably it can disappear just as easily.
  

"Before I make my proposal, I want you to consider the   nature of this amazing, amazing weapon. It is not the end of life, nothing so   dramatic; nor is it merely the biggest cannon in existence. It is the beginning   of a new era, of peace and prosperity, at so long last. It is the leverage we   need to bring the Empires to hell, them and the murderous capsuleers."
  

He paused, and looked each one of them in the eyes.
  

"But Control won't see it that way. The moment we   involve the faction, the weapon is effectively destroyed. Doesn't matter whether   we give it away or manage to keep it for ourselves, Control would see to it that   this magnificent creation of forcible peace would be dismantled. At most the   Food Relief corp would use it for some momentary diplomatic wrangling, but even   they wouldn't fight to keep the thing for long.
  

"So we have a superweapon here. And based on the   traces of isogen-5 in its core, the same isogen-5 the drones are harvesting, I   would say we have found its fuel source. The gun and the bullets, within our   reach. All we need is our hand on the trigger.
  

"I want us to engage the drones in dialogue."
  

Their eyes went wide.
  

"We will seek passage in the name of the Sisters and   of humanity, something we have done with great success in the past. No one, not   even the bloodiest of the Sani Sabik or the most haunted of Sansha's slaves, has   ever denied us passage in times of true need.
  

"We were brought to this place for a reason, and I   believe that on the other side, in clear view, is our holy grail."
  

He sat down and laced his fingers behind his head.   Everything he had said, he felt, was as true as anything could ever be. The   weapon needed to be theirs.
  

"Sir ..." one of the navigators said. He faltered,   cleared his throat and began again. "Sir, I've been on hundreds of missions for   the Sisters, and this thing is death incarnate."
  

The captain fixed him with a glare.
  

The other navigator said, "It's ... frightening. But I   have never questioned my superiors. This is what we signed up for."
  

The first said, "This is not what we signed up for.   Death and destruction is not what we signed up for." His cheeks were bright red.
  

The second replied, "But this is where we are, and   this is the choice we have to make."
  

The team debated, and the captain allowed it to   proceed to a vote. Shortly after, they all left the room, the decision made by   majority. Strangely enough, and unknown to the captain, each of the persons   inside the room had their own ideas of what would be done to the weapon once it   was retrieved, and what would be done to their captain.
  

They went forth and gave their orders.
  

The ship moved on. The drones noticed them and started   their targeting, but did not yet engage. The crew felt the sinking weight of a   hundred different red crosshairs aimed directly on them.
  

The team opened a communication channel. And a message   made its way from the captain's lips, through the ship's computer, and was   broadcast to all drones in the vicinity.
  

It sought passage in the name of the Sisters of EVE   and of the humanity of life, adding that this was not a new occurrence by any   means. It explained the nature of their belief, which was rock solid in   uncertain times. For good measure it added a brief history of the Sisters'   accomplishment both humanitarian and scientific, concluding with a suitably   simplified repetition of their request that the drones acknowledge the Sisters'   higher purpose and right to passage, and let them through.
  

The message seemed to have no effect. The channel did   not report acknowledgment or acceptance.
  

The captain realized with a sinking feeling that these   things might never have been asked to give humans passage based on goodwill. He   did not even know if goodwill meant anything to them.
  

Eventually the drones started to move. One of the   navigators, the person in charge of communications, shook his head.
  

In a tone as steady as he could keep it, the captain   asked, "Did they say anything?"
  

The navigator gave him a worried look and said, "Sir,   I think they did. But I don't even know if it's in response to us."
  

"Speak, man! What is it?"
  

The drones were moving closer now, their pincers and   claws at the ready.
  

"Sir ... it's an endless string of binary. Ones, over   and over again."
  

The first few drones took down the ship's shields like   they were wading through fog. The second wave latched on and immediately started   piercing its armor with their massive pincers. The vessel's guns picked off one   or two, but before any more shots could be fired, the drones had broken through.
  

And the ship's captain learned that faith is not   enough, for faith is blind by nature. Life needs insight. It is the dead, and   the dying, that allow themselves to be led.
