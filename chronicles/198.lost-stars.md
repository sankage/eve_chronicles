Investigation of Failed Product "Quafe+"</i></p>

<p></p>

Sir,


<p></p>

<p>We have concluded our research pertaining
to the failed launch of the product "Quafe+." Enclosed are initial research and
preliminary documents for your perusal. We have stopped production of this
product before it could hit distribution. All implicated parties have been
dealt with in proper fashion. The authorities have not been contacted. Gheyr
Aillon is no longer with the company. The investigation will conclude in the
next week after the guilty parties have been re-massed. Please find below the
investigation's core documentation:</p>

<p>I sold out today, and I could not be
happier. Viladillet's office sent me their newest offer, and I couldn't turn
them down. It was more than generous for my fleet of junkers. Those Quafe
bastards are losing their touch the bigger they get; either that or they're
desperate for the biomass. Quafe+ must be behind schedule. I don't know why
they want us to keep at the morgue runs. All I can gather is that it's to keep
an emotional face on that lumbering beast of a conglomerate.</p>

<i>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</i>


<p></p>

<p><b>Quafe Corporations Merges with Lost
Stars, Inc.</b></p>

<p></p>

<p>Lirsautton – The Quafe Corporation, through
its affiliated development group Quafe Enterprises, has completed their merger
with Lost Stars, Inc., a Federation-based funerary services agency that
specializes in cleaning up the aftermath of starship engagements throughout the
Gallente Federation. The companies agreed to a merger agreement in which Lost
Stars will join the myriad companies comprising Quafe Enterprises' burgeoning
business conglomeration.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Lost Stars, Inc. was founded in YC 106 by
Yosif Veaulore, who started the business with his son, Perime. From the
corporation's beginnings as a single frigate retrieving the bodies of crew
members from deadspace pockets, Lost Stars, Inc. currently maintains a fleet of
over 2,000 ships, many custom designed for deep space retrieval missions.
Through the deal, Lost Stars will provide an important role in Quafe
Enterprise's new Industrial Services division. "We are proud to be a part of
the Quafe family," says Lost Stars' president Veaulore. "We hope to provide a
human element to Quafe to show that there's more to the corporation than beverages."</p>

<p></p>

<p>I'm worried about Perime. I thought that
maybe he'd get better in this new environment. His messages are sullen and
terse to me – at least, much more than usual. I made sure the Quafe suits
didn't audit his files, and I transferred him to a new ship. I've done all I
can to keep him safe and out of trouble. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p></p>

<p>Perime tried to convince me that this was a
bad deal, that I'd hurt him if I went through with it. He doesn't have much to
stand on. He sold me his shares the last time he got in trouble. It was the
only way I could keep his problems quiet. This business was his idea. That's
why I still keep him on staff, even if he's under an assumed name. I have to
keep him close to me; I love him too much. This will be a good change for him,
I know it.</p>

<p><i>An excerpt from the New Acquisition
Progress Report – Lost Stars, Inc., a Quafe Corporation company.</i></p>

<p></p>

<b>Q2 YC112</b>


<p></p>

<p>From the start of the quarter, biomass
retrieval operations have increased 200% over Q2 last year, though the number
of retrieval requests has gone down by 40%. Most of the biomass collected from
deadspace locations and battle sites is reprocessed for use within the company,
though a small percentage (5%) of the collected human biomass is sold to
cloning facilities throughout the Federation.</p>

<p></p>

Estimated numbers:


<p>Average number of bodies retrieved from
deadspace locations: 5,000</p>

<p>Average number of bodies retrieved from
capsuleer engagements (30 ships destroyed): 1,000</p>

<p>Average requests for individuals to be
retrievals per engagement: 100 </p>

<p></p>

<p>Most biomass retrieved from these locations
consists of starship crew members who did not survive the engagement: Their
ship's hull was breached before they could escape through escape pods. This
recovered biomass is often unrecognizable, exposed as it is to the vacuum of
space. When requests to retrieve individual bodies from this wreckage come
through, the price is often well above normal for funeral costs. Upper-income
families are the overwhelming majority of clients for Lost Stars, as they wish
to give their relatives lost to starship engagements a proper burial. The
Servant Sisters of EVE are also major clients, providing donations to
under-privileged families to pay for retrieval and funeral costs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>They've done wonders with my ships: repairs
on all the ships, new crews, new equipment. Like new salvage drones (for about
half of the ships, at least). No more space walks ("death marches," as the
crews used to call them). Now they can send those drones out to fetch the
corpses instead of sending my men out there. Gallente liberty means freedom
from dangerous work, right? I'm expecting that within a year we'll have all the
ships fitted with these new modules. That'll probably mean massive layoffs at
that time. That's the price of safety. </p>

<p><i>Personnel files: biography of Gheyr
Aillon, Project Lead for Quafe+</i></p>

<i> </i>


<p>Aillon was born to a family of miners in a
deep-cavern mining community on Mannar. Both of his parents were killed in a
deep-core explosion when Aillon was eight years old. He lived with relatives
and family friends throughout Mannar until he turned eighteen. Though
impoverished throughout his childhood, he had a natural talent for learning and
and eloquence beyond his years. When he was of age, he attended the University of
Caille on a full scholarship. Graduating at the top of his class with a degree
in Marketing, he entered the Federation's corporate world in a blaze, founding
several small companies and turning them into instant successes. Some of the
corporations folded shortly after Aillon left them, but a few still remain as
part of Quafe Enterprise's conglomeration. Three years ago, Aillon became the
youngest project lead in the history of the Quafe Corporation at the age of 31.</p>

<p><i>From the journal of Yosif Veaulore,
April 30, YC112</i>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Perime's getting worse. I've barely spoken
to him in the last month. He's angry with me, he must be. To him, it was always
about helping people. Am I losing sight of that? No, I can't be. I'm helping
more people than ever; progress does nothing but good to people.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That's why Perime wanted me to start this
company with him, or at least that was the front he put on. We had lost his
mother to one of these engagements. She and I were divorced by that point –
"irreconcilable differences" – but Perime loved her so much, and it broke his
heart when she started working as an engineer for those big, new starships. She
had only been working the space lanes for about a year when her ship was
destroyed in a capsuleer engagement. Total destruction of the Thorax on which
she was stationed. Four eggers caught the ship by surprise in an asteroid belt
in Intaki. They tore the ship apart before all of the escape pods could get
away. Verine didn't make it out. We tried several times to reach the capsuleer
in charge of that Thorax, pleading for him to help us recover her body so we
could give it a proper burial. He never returned our messages.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Perime was barely a man by that point, but
he still had a child's temper. He went into his dark rage, the worst I've ever
seen him. I lost contact with him for about a month. It was only when the
hospital contacted me that I knew he was alive, though he was badly beaten,
almost to the point of death. He never told me where he went, but that didn't
matter. I was just happy to know he was alive. That's when he proposed the
business to me. I couldn't turn the boy down, so I promised to give it a shot,
regardless of the cost. Anything to keep him safe and close.</p>

<p><i>An excerpt from a speech by  Gheyr
Aillon toinvestors</i>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Quafe+ represents the evolution of soft
drinks in New Eden.  With Quafe+, we hope to turn our marketed beverages from
leisure products to dietary staples. We're in a 'want' market, where consumers
want our product on an almost daily basis to quench their thirst. But we must
expand past this point and turn our product into a 'need' market. We must have
people needing Quafe+, demanding it for their very sake. This need does not
have to be a physical dependency, mind. We're not some seedy organization like
the Serpentis. Rather, this is a cultural need, a social need, and a spiritual
need. Quafe+ is the culmination of the familiar, a socio-genetic need for any
culture. We envision this product as absolutely necessary for progress into the
future.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"And for that, my dear investors, I reveal
to you Quafe+'s marketing campaign. It's entitled, 'Quafe+: A Familiar Taste
for a Better Tomorrow.' We will begin our campaign at the end of this year and
start selling the product in the Genesis region next year."</p>

<p><i>From the journal of Yosif Veaulore,

<p></p>

<p>We never wanted to make a profit, but we
did over time. There were just too many ships out there and too much
destruction not to grow our business. Even though the capsuleers took control
of the ship, they still needed a crew. And when they got into their territorial
pissing matches, when those demigods started to destroy each other en masse,
that's when business started picking up. While the eggers could lose their ship
and their pod and wake up in a cloning vat somewhere, their crew members were
not so lucky. When that starship exploded – and it almost always exploded – if
you didn't get into your escape pod quick enough, you were lost in the black,
forgotten, disgorged, alone. That's where we came in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We could empathize; we knew what it was
like to lose a loved one to the dark void. Verine wasn't lucky enough to have a
funeral. But others could be, and we provided that service. It was dangerous
work – we lost about 20% of our workers on the death marches – but it gave
someone closure. We didn't want to be profitable, but there was too much
business to be had. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The business was all about collecting the
dead, harvesting the forgotten. We collected millions of bodies over the years.
We did our best to categorize them and contact the next of kin, and the
technology grew quickly over the years. DNA scanners, facial reconstruction
simulators, biomass regenerators, and biological recursion solvents aided in
identifying the lost souls. But not everyone could pay our prices – we were
still a business, after all. Most of the time, though, we either couldn't find
a next of kin or the family didn't care about our recovery. That's when we sold
the bodies for biomass – human recycling at its nadir. And that's when Quafe
became interested in us.</p>

Dr. Simuel Touvoux, Director of Research and Riesves Boricon, Marketing
Manager. April 14, YC112. From internal communications network and surveillance
unit</i>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>TOUVOUX: How're the focus groups responding
to the new flavoring agents?</p>

<p>BORICON: They can't get enough of it!
Product demand within 12 hours of consumption is up 300%. It's like they're
addicted to Quafe+. I've never seen anything like it. Your team has done
wonders. This is practically alchemy you've discovered, doctor.</p>

<p>TOUVOUX: It was surprisingly simple to
produce the requisite flavoring agents, to be completely honest. Once we found
the proper source for biomass, it was a matter of fiddling with the chemical
compounds. </p>

<p>BORICON: Where are you getting your biomass
from? What's so special about this biomass, anyway?</p>

<p>TOUVOUX: Quafe Enterprises is supplying it
to us. Gheyr Aillon says that it's specific to one solar system somewhere in
Pureblind. I don't ask too many questions: biomass is biomass, to be honest.
Besides, we're already behind schedule on this project already, and we would be
even more behind if we didn't find that flavoring agent.</p>

<p>BORICON: Is Viladillet aware of any of
this?</p>

<p>TOUVOUX: We're keeping him posted on
progress, but not really giving him too many details. The old man's too caught
up in developing Enterprises to really care about the product even more.</p>

<p>BORICON: All he cares about is results,
anyway. Frankly, that's all that matters in this world. This product is rather
low on the totem pole, but I see the potential for it to revolutionize the
company. Maybe that will catch his attention.</p>

<p>I don't have much control over my company
anymore. At least, not the way I wanted. I guess that's what I get for selling
out. I'm still in charge of the business's daily operations, but I have no
control over its direction. The suits are in charge of that now. It's not about
helping people anymore.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I can't even tell what they're doing with
the biomass anymore. Aillon keeps shutting me out of those conversations. Our
operating efficiency has gone through the roof, and we're collecting more
bodies than ever! (It helps when there's more capsuleers in the sky to blast one
another into oblivion, but now I'm just being morbid.) I've been cut off from
all of my business partners and all the recycling plants that we had deals
with. Hell, I can't even talk to the Sisters anymore. They're still our
customer, but they go straight through Aillon's office at this point. That
brash bastard – he's trying to take too much control. He should stick to his
stupid Quafe+ project and leave us be. </p>

<p></p>

<p>And to make matters worse, I can't even get

<i>Incident Report</i>


<p><i>Lost Stars, Inc., a division of Quafe
Corporation</i></p>

<i>Biomass Recovery ship, "Eulogy"</i>


<i>May 10<sup>th</sup>, YC112</i>


<p></p>

<p>In the early hours of May 10<sup>th</sup>,
YC112, several crewmen aboard this vessel discovered an employee, Eamom
Delviour, to be stealing biomass from the storage facility aboard the ship.
Delviour was found in an unoccupied sector of the ship – formerly the ship's galley,
before the "Eulogy" was owned by Quafe Corporation – hiding more than 20 bodies
in a storage freezer. This sector of the ship was restricted to authorized
personnel only, though ship logs report that almost no crew member besides
Delviour had entered the area in at least four months.</p>

<p></p>

<p>According to the ship's security
investigation, the stolen biomass was preserved with embalming liquids and DNA purifiers
stolen from Lab C. Each preserved body maintained most of its structural
integrity, and each body was formerly female. Most of the bodies contained some
wounds and discoloration throughout the torso area, though the causes of these
markings are unknown. Significant traces of Delviour's DNA have been found on
some of the bodies as well.</p>

<p></p>

<p>By ship protocol, intact biomass is
considered a premium and as such is closely recorded. However, as Delviour was
one of the few space walkers onboard, his biomass collection was never fully
recorded, which explains how he managed to collect so many bodies undetected.
The space walking regiment on board the "Eulogy" has been dismissed entirely
and the ship is currently docked and will be fitted with biomass recovery
drones within the next few weeks.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Eamom Delviour has been taken into custody
by Quafe security, who have performed a complete background check. Delviour was
operating as an employee of Lost Stars, Inc. under an assumed identity. His
real name is Perime Veaulore, son of Lost Stars president Yosif Veaulore, and a
wanted fugitive within the Federation for the crimes of unlawful harvesting of
biomass, assault and battery, and a classified charge under the "Dead Rights Amendment."
Security personnel found very few possessions in his bunk area: a few changes
of clothes, multiple IDs for other assumed identities, and a picture of an
Intaki woman. There was also a felchon, a plasma knife commonly found among
Mannar gangs, hidden beneath his bunk. </p>

<p></p>

<p>The recovered biomass has been destroyed to
preserve the integrity of the corporation's product identity. This matter will
be dealt with internally, and no federal authority is to be notified of
Veaulore's crimes against the corporation.</p>

Dr. Simuel Touvoux, Director of Research, and Macal Theloux, President, Quafe
Enterprises</i></p>

<p></p>

Touvoux and Theloux,


<p></p>

<p>We have increased our production of biomass
for your flavoring agents. Efficiency within the Lost Stars operation is up
nearly 200%. We have added more ships to our fleet and expanded our harvesting
range to include Republic space. We are also looking to purchase the regional
biomass retrieval service, Bountiful Harvests, from Boundless Creation within
the next few months. With the increase in harvesting operations, we should
acquire enough biomass to meet demand of Quafe+ upon launch, as long as your
team can mass-produce the flavoring agent in time. I will keep you updated. So
far, nobody is aware of the agent's source, though Internal Affairs has been
asking questions lately. I'm not worried,though: We kept Veaulore around for a
reason.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I sold out, and I'm getting exactly what I
deserve. I haven't talked to Perime in months, I'm getting blackballed from all
executive meetings, and Internal Affairs is breathing down my neck for reasons
I cannot understand. I just wanted to help people, to soothe them when they
lost someone close to them. Why is this happening to me?</p>

<p></p>

<p>I have a meeting with Theloux and Aillon
tomorrow. The suits don't seem happy with me or how Lost Stars is operating. I
don't know why they're blaming me; Aillon's the one that's stonewalling me!
I'll find out what he wants tomorrow. In fact, I think it's time I stand up to
that bastard. I've been out of the loop for too long. I need to stand firm,
take charge, and steer Lost Stars back to the proper course, the righteous
course – the course I started with Perime. Then I'll take Perime out of hiding
and put him back on the executive level with me. Back where he belongs! They'll
understand why I hid him; Quafe's got the pull to get the charges against him
dropped. I'll try one more time to contact Perime after my meeting tomorrow. </p>

<p></p>

OFFICER: Why were you stealing bodies?


<p>VEAULORE: The same reason Quafe needs the
bodies: I have to fulfill my needs.</p>

<p>OFFICER: How many have you stolen since the
merger?</p>

<p>VEAULORE: A pittance compared to the amount
Quafe has repurposed. Do you even know what they do with the biomass?</p>

<p>OFFICER: We're not here to talk about what
your company does. We're here to talk about what you did to the company. Tell
me: How many bodies have you stolen?</p>

<p>VEAULORE: I can't even count at this point.
Everybody's heads are so far up their collective asses that it became too easy.
I got greedy, just like Aillon.</p>

OFFICER: Give me a rough estimate.


<p>VEAULORE: A few dozen, maybe. I only stole
them once I got the urges. I'm not healthy, you know.</p>

OFFICER: That's an understatement.


<p>VEAULORE: Though I'm nowhere as perverted
as your bosses. My sickness stopped at myself; I always gave the bodies a
proper burial once I was done with them. But you guys; you're abominations.
Especially Aillon.</p>

<p>OFFICER: You don't know what you're talking
about. </p>

<p>VEAULORE: Follow the paper trail. See where
all this biomass goes once we collect it. Then you'll see who the real
criminals are.</p>

<b><i>Subject</i></b><i><span lang="EN-US">: Cease Production Immediately</span></i>


<p></p>

Sirs,


<p></p>

<p>After a lead from our security personnel,
we have begun investigations into the production of Quafe+, particularly its
flavoring agents. The source of these agents, originally described as coming
from a particular plant in the Pureblind region, has been proven false by
independent researchers. With the full cooperation of Mr. Theloux, we have
investigated the true source of the biomass required to produce these flavoring
agents: biomass harvested through Lost Stars, Inc., an entity within Quafe
Enterprises that specializes in collecting human remains from starship
engagements. </p>

<p></p>

<p>We have apprehended the company's
president, Yosif Veaulore, as we believe that he provided the corporation with
falsified documents relating to the distribution of his company's harvested
biomass. With the help of Dr. Touvoux and Mr. Boricon, who have both provided
the full documented reports from Mr. Veaulore and his company, we can state
with complete certainty that Veaulore acted independently of any other entity
within Quafe Enterprises and Quafe Corporation as a whole. We have also
apprehended his accomplice, Perime Veaulore, his son and former business
partner, who is wanted by federal authorities for crimes committed prior to the
merger of Lost Stars, Inc. and Quafe Enterprises.</p>

<p></p>

<p>At the request of Internal Affairs, we ask
that all development and production of Quafe+ be halted immediately until such
time that we can conclude our investigation.</p>
