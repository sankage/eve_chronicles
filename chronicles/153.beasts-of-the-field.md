# Beasts of the Field

![Beasts of the Field](images/beasts.jpg)
     



The scene is a bar in the Great Wildlands, at the   outskirts of Minmatar space. It is very late at night.
  

A recent war in New Eden has spurred the three lost   Minmatar tribes to return home. The Thukkers, wanderers of space, have been   invited to rejoin the Republic, and are preparing for their section of space to   become an autonomous part of the Minmatar collective. The Nefantar, also known   as the Ammatars, who were thought to have been traitors against their own people   in an older war, were revealed as protectors and invited back after their   homeworld was ravaged. The Starkmanir, once thought extinct but kept alive   through the good grace of the Nefantar, were rescued and offered to rejoin their   people.
  

It is a time of war, and integration of these three   tribes has temporarily taken a back seat to the efforts on the front lines. In   the meanwhile, refugees and hopefuls from the tribes have situated themselves in   refugee stations such as this one, waiting for permission, visas, housing and   jobs in Minmatar space. The bar is in the middle of one of those refugee areas.
  

SISPUR, a Nefantar, sits at his table, drinking.   ANNES, a Starkmanir, enters, gets a beer from the bartender, looks around at the   empty hall, and eventually goes over to SISPUR's table, pulling up a chair.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">This free?</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Sure.</p>  

ANNES sits.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Didn't think anyone else would be here. Most   everyone is at home, asleep.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Most everyone clearly doesn't have any worries about   uprooting from their home, taking whatever stuff they could carry and plonking   it down here while they wait to hear if the homeland will take them in at last.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">It'll take us in, there's no doubt about that. You   know it as well as I do.</p>  

SISPUR takes a long sip from his drink.
  

<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Yeah, I guess I do. But I hate the waiting. I had a   life back on Ammatar, sad as it was. I was appreciated in my own way. I don't   like waiting to be taken into a place where I'm not appreciated, much as I want   to get back.</p>  

TRIAT, a Thukker man, enters the bar, grabs a drink   and sits down at the same table without a word.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">How's it going?</p>  

ANNES and SISPUR look at him wordlessly.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Pretty dead here tonight. Thought I was the only one   alive.</p>  

TRIAT laughs.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">So what you guys doing up here so late? You selling?</p>  

TRIAT looks at the two stone faces, then laughs again.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Nevermind. Anyone catch the game recently?</p>  

TRIAT drains his glass, burps and waves at the   bartender.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Hey! Fill-up!</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR, in a frosty tone</p>  <p align="CENTER">So, is this the part where you show us your tattoos?</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Or puke all over the table, maybe?</p>  

TRIAT stares at them. The bartender comes over and   fills his glass. There is a tense moment; then TRIAT rubs his face with his   hands, sighs and chuckles a little.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Not coming off too well, am I?</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">I've seen Fedos with better personality, really.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">But you're welcome to join us, if you like. Not as   if there's anything else to do right now.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Sorry, guys. I've been hanging out with the thuks   too much. I'm Triat.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Sispur.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Annes.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">I'm the local traitor, and Annes here's the local   revolution symbol, and we were just talking about how our motherland seems to   want us here and gone all at the same time. What's keeping you up this time of   night?</p>  

TRIAT leans back in his chair and gives this proper   thought.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">The same, I guess. I dunno if you know how we live,   travelling through space and selling our stuff, but there isn't as much   insecurity as you might think. If you're going to eke out some kind of existence   up here, you need to be real good at being proactive, finding your own sources   of raw material and working your own deals.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">And you think rejoining the Republic will damage   that.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Well, if all that independence is completely taken   away, and everything is out of your hands, you're going to get uncomfortable.   Stop sleeping, maybe. Drink instead and act like a fool.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">But you guys are joining up by choice, or at least   you voted to have the Wildlands turn into some quasi-esque part of Republic   space. You all retain your holdings and your independence. It doesn't seem like   your life has to change that much.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">I don't think that's what he's after.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Oh?</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">I think he's one of the Thukkers who's actually   moving house, into the Republic</p>  

TRIAT nods.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">There were votes, and talk of independence, but the   writing really is on the wall for anyone not too stupid to read it. The Republic   is going to go through an upswing. And as much as we Thukkers brag about living   on the edge, we do spend a lot more time than we'd ever admit simply trying not   to look down.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">So you want safety.</p>  

TRIAT looks a little hurt at the comment.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">I think it'd be nice simply to have a home again.   Some base of operations where I can solidify, get my act together, and rely on   tomorrow being the same as today. Somewhere that doesn't tremble as it moves. Or   move at all, come to that.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">And it looks like that's about to happen. So why're   you awake, and drinking?</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Because I think too much. Like I said, you stay   proactive, always looking for connections and deals, which is about the same as   looking for a way you can crowbar yourself into someone else's business. It's   about being dominant. And that's impossible in this life I have now, when I'm   waiting for some outside system to lay down the law for me.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
TRIAT takes a drink
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">But it's better than that dead uncertainty. It has   to be. How is it with you guys?</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">I'm pretty certain.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">That's good.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">I'm certain I'm going to be treated like crap over   there.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Really?</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Sure.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">I thought you guys were heroes.</p>  

TRIAT points his glass at ANNES
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">For saving your asses. No offence.</p>  

ANNES smiles.
  

<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">That was only a small group of people. The rest of   us ...</p>  

SISPUR takes a deep breath.
  

<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">The rest of us just tried to get stuff done the best   we could. Live our lives and not leave anyone off any worse than we had to. We   weren't traitors of the Minmatar cause, any more than we were saviors of the   Starkmanir.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">But people treat you that way.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Either or, yes. Scum of the earth or savior of the   people. We're not humans in their eyes, we're symbols.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">No, I think we're the symbols.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Well, all right. True. Then we're the mirrors.   People use us to see what's inside themselves. If they want to see Minmatar   having been betrayed, ruined and left in tatters, then that's what we are to   them. If they want everything to have worked out, with the saviors of the slaves   and all that, then that's what we helped accomplish. They externalize their   feelings on us.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">We've had some of that, too. But we're used to   people ragging on us. Comes with being a merchant.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">We're not used to it at all. I don't know what we're   used to. I don't even know what we are.</p>  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">People seem to think you're simpletons, for the most   part.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">What do you think?</p>  

TRIAT takes a sip from his drink
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">I think you know when to be quiet, which is a lot   more important than most people realize.</p>  

ANNES nods to SISPUR.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">I don't want to be accepted back to the fold.</p>  

ANNES nods to TRIAT.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">I don't even want to find a new home. I want my old   home back. It wasn't an easy life, but it wasn't bad, either. It was just a   life.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Half a life, some might say. And thanks to us - or   despite us - you're now being brought into the full glory of what you can be.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Apparently those people know me better than I know   myself. You know what's funny? Those very same people are treating us Starkmanir   like the beasts of the field.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
ANNES lifts his glass close to SISPUR, and stares at   him through it, wide-eyed.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">They'll go up to us and say, "THIS ... IS CALLED ...   A KHUMAAK. CAN YOU SAY KHUMAAK?"</p>  

ANNES lowers the glass again, leans back and takes a   sip.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Apparently we're budding geniuses and slobbering   retards all at the same time.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">And you were taken from slavery and left floating in   space, so now there's a huge amount of insecurity brewing in your ranks.</p>  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Yeah. Because we really don't want to be ungrateful.   Really, we don't. But we've suddenly had this new identity thrust on us, and   have no idea who we are anymore. Just the same as you guys-</p>  

ANNES nods to SISPUR
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">-and now we're just ... there. Like figures carved   out of wood.</p>  

TRIAT raises his glass
  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Beasts of the field, man.</p>  

TRIAT, ANNES and SISPUR clink their glasses together.   ANNES starts to say something, then stops.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">This ... drunken woman came up to me the other day.   Thoroughly, thoroughly drunk. It was in some bar, before I was transferred to   this camp. I was on my own, minding my own business when she said to me, way too   loudly, that she wanted to take me home and have sex with me.</p>  

TRIAT and SISPUR's eyes go wide. TRIAT takes a sip of   his beer to cover his surprise.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">She said she'd never done it with a Starkie</p>  

TRIAT chokes on his beer.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Hey, you okay?</p>  

TRIAT nods and takes a moment to regain his composure,   with ANNES looking on concernedly.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Uh, how'd you get out of that one?</p>  

ANNES smiles faintly and looks at the air.
  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Who says I did?</p>  

TRIAT and SISPUR fall quiet.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">It wasn't that great. She had nice breasts, though.</p>  

TRIAT and SISPUR remain quiet.
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES laughs.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">What? You guys think I'm backwards, too? Come on.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
TRIAT takes a small sip of his beer.
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">No, you're right. I guess we're all human.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">And that's really it, isn't it? I mean, on paper my   choice was either to leave or to remain in a politically unstable shithole. But   even if it wasn't, I can't say that I'd still have stayed behind.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">Even if you're being treated like you shouldn't be   here? Or that you should be grateful? It's the last chance to turn around, you   know. You could join up with the Gallente. They love us.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">Even despite all that, no. I still want to go in. I   don't know anybody in Minmatar space, and I'm certainly reminded of that on a   regular basis, but I still feel like I know, if not the people, then the nation   itself. You know?</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
TRIAT nods to ANNES and grins
  

<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <i>  </i><p align="CENTER">He's certainly gotten to know the people.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">That one occasion aside, I don't even have the   background that you guys have. All I've ever known is that I was destined to   live in Ammatar space, growing up as part of a system that had little to do with   the Minmatar and everything to do with the Amarr. And to be honest, even if I'm   treated like a freak, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm somewhere I   belong. It's not that I think these people wanted me in their lives, but it's   ... it's clear they needed <i>something</i>. There was a gap, there was this   dark, raw opening where the people of my tribe were torn from the body of the   Minmatar all those years ago, and the remainder of that body cannot rest until   we're rejoined. If there's an adjustment period, and there will be, and if   there's pain, and there'll certainly be plenty of that before we start to heal   at last, then that's how it has to be. I have to accept that, and play my part   in the healing the best I can.</p>  

ANNES looks at TRIAT
  

<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">Even if you left of your own accord - as a nation, I   mean - and although you personally may be returning for your own reasons, I   think you're partly brought back by the same force that pulled me in.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">TRIAT</p>  <p align="CENTER">By being part of something greater? Yeah. Could be   right. Some greater whole. Something outside ourselves.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">SISPUR</p>  <p align="CENTER">And something we can be proud of, something that   stands for the same things we do as individuals.</p>  <p align="CENTER">  </p>
<p align="CENTER">ANNES</p>  <p align="CENTER">And lets us stand for something, not merely what we   represent but who we are.</p>  

TRIAT raises his glass, as does SISPUR and ANNES
  

ALL say, To Matar!
