# Burnt

![Burnt](images/Burnt.jpg)
<p>As the shuttle hovered towards the
colony, Kanen looked out the viewport and marveled at the familiar terrain.
He'd rarely seen it from this height, his face far too close to the dirt, and
the last time he'd left the place he hadn't been in a state to enjoy much of anything
at all.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The towers poked out of the ground like
nails dropped into sand. The colony stayed in intense communication not only
with nearby colonies and travelling starships, but with authorities much
farther away. Its operations were regulated according to policies that Kanen
had never really understood. Sometimes the crew was worked harder than usual,
and sometimes ... well, sometimes nothing. They always worked hard. It was a
question of calluses versus actual cuts.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Beneath the towers, the familiar rock
and mud and mess. And, in the distance, the roiling magma that made it viable
for human beings even to eke out a living on this rock. This was an active
place, full of active people harnessing some very dangerous equipment, all sitting
on top of what was effectively a big, crackling, active celestial volcano.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And beyond them, Kanen saw sky-wide
nebulas streaking through all viewable space, dotted by planets in their
thousands. Each one of those planets, Kanen reflected, by the sheer dint of
their glow, would be large enough to eclipse his colony.</p>

<p></p>

<p>He looked down again. The burning glow
from the magma reflected off the shuttle, casting it in red and orange hues.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Goddamn," Kanen muttered to
himself. As the shuttle started to descend he felt the light pull on his
stomach and hands, as if someone wanted him away from the seat and out of the
vessel; out for inspection by the stars that watched his every move from above.
Away from the colony.</p>

<p><i>The hardest part in anyone's life
isn't the crises they encounter, and if someone tries to tell you different, it
says more about their lack of spine than it does about whatever problems
they've had. Anyone can have a problem, or make mistakes, or suffer a goddamn
breakdown. The question isn't what happened to you or what scars life
inconsiderately raked over your hide - it's what you did after. How you got up
again.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p align="center" style="text-align:center">***</p>

<p></p>

<p>He walked slowly through the corridors
of the colony's main operational section. There was no rush: he was expected by
some people, and not by others, and he would take the time he needed to get
this thing done right.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It was odd to be back, particularly
without a task to work on. When you have been active for long enough in a
particular place, you no longer see how it truly looks in brick and mortar, and
instead experience it solely as the accumulation of tasks, needs, pauses and
schedules at which you, of course, are the center. This giant wall, reaching to
a ceiling many man-heights above, is no longer a wall; it is a route to someone's
office where that meeting needs to be held, or a support structure that will
need to be relocated as soon as the company moves on to the mineable rock
beyond it, or simply a quiet place where you can take a breather for five
minutes in between shifts and bum a cigarette from a pal. But when you leave -
not merely this place but the web of duties, actions and results it has woven
you into - and then you come back, you come back to it as a dead thing. You
stand outside the life it contains, like a ghost. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He walked down corridors that held few people,
even fewer he knew and none of whom seemed to know him. A door at the end bore
the moniker <i>Betel Saraanen</i> and the title <i>Supervisor</i> below it. </p>

<p></p>

<p>Kanen knocked and entered. A man sitting
at a desk looked up from a slew of reports, blinked a couple of times before he
recognized the visitor, and said, "I want you gone."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Don't we all," Kanen said. He
closed the door behind him and leaned against it. There was a chair in the room
but he did not sit down, nor did Betel indicate he was expected to.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I want you gone," Betel
repeated, "but there's rumors of Sansha coming in, so we've got the usual
panicky flights off-base, and the capsuleers have wrecked nearby colonies to
the point where we can't pull in new teams."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"And the ore needs to be
mined."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"The ore doesn't need the likes of
you," Betel told him, then confirmed with a sigh, "But the ore, yes,
does need to be mined."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Kanen stood there in silence, listening
to the rhythm of the colony. The regular beats that drummed up through the
floor proved the mining works were operating at full swing, and the occasional
tremor through the wall against his back indicated that the explosives experts
were gleefully earning their pay.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"So you better get to work,"
Betel said at last. "The details are in your datapad." </p>

<p></p>

<p align="center" style="text-align:center">***</p>

<p></p>

<p><i>You don't spring back to action.
That's what I learned. After breaking away, and taking the time off you needed
to recuperate, you're not exactly raring to go again. Rather, you need to
slowly rev yourself up, like an old, worn, grimily oiled piece of mining
equipment, spluttering and coughing in the poisonous air of the mines, sidling
and sliding into action one more time. You haven't had a broken part replaced;
you overheated and were given time to cool down, but nothing in you is back to
new. Just a little tattered, perhaps a little broken, and uncertain how much
it'll take before you give way again.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p align="center" style="text-align:center">***</p>

<p></p>

<p>The workers' changing rooms were a ways
down to the far end of the colony. Kanen knew his allotment, locker and
equipment had been left untouched, likely less out of respect than a feeling of
bad luck. Miners cared about luck. They'd run out so often that they viciously
hoarded what little they managed to scrounge.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There was a good while left of the
current shift, and when it ended another one would begin. According to his
datapad entry, Kanen had been assigned an area to oversee, but not a particular
team of people; rather, he would be present along with any other midlevel
overseers on shift to guide operations in that particular part of the mining
grid and to jump in as needed when brute force was required. He could walk in
at any time and start picking up the slack. The active team wouldn't be happy,
but that was no worry of his. The active team working in the depths of an
unstable asteroid colony, floating around unprotected in deepest space, was not
expected to be happy.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So it was with no pressure but that of the
churning dread of guilt that he turned and headed not to the changing rooms,
but to the living quarters on the other side of the colony. He got in at least
a minute's walk before a familiar voice called out his name, and a body marched
straight up to him.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Corwan," he said to the
approaching form. He walked on at the same pace. The younger man, who was about
his height but rather less built, sped to keep up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Good to have you back, man,"
Corwan said. He seemed about to slap Kanen on the shoulder, then reconsidered.
"How you doing?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>Kanen gave him a look. "What can I
do for you, Corwan?" he asked.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Well, I'm just wondering. I'd
heard you were back and wanted to see if we could have a chat about some, uh,
staff issues."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"If <i>we</i> could talk about
staff issues?"</p>

<p></p>

"Certainly."


<p></p>

<p>"Would those be," Kanen slowly
said, "staff issues that occurred <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> I
pile-drived a massive operational piece of mining equipment into a pit full of
an intensely, if briefly, surprised group of people? Are those the ones <i>we</i>
should discuss?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"That wasn't your fault,"
Corwan quickly said.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"It was very much my fault, unless
you want to pick out someone in that pit as having deserved what happened to
them."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"No! No, no, not at all. But, uh,
we do need to think about some changes that have been occurring here, or
needing to occur, even before the incident. Are you coming back full time, by
the way?"</p>

<p></p>

"Supposedly," Kanen said.


<p></p>

"As an overseer?"


<p></p>

<p>Kanen ran a hand over his face as he
walked, then shot the man another look. "Corwen, it's not that I don't
appreciate having at least one person here happy to see me. But the mere fact
that I'm back here in my old position, however temporarily, means there's one
less slot for you to grab if it's overseer status you're angling for; and don't
â€“" He raised a hand at Corwen, who looked very intent on saying something.
"Don't pretend that you're not climbing, because <i>we've </i>seen you
from afar, coming up, knife in mouth. So let's skip all the camaraderie and the
united front dumbass farce, and engage with the real issue instead. What is it
you really want?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>Corwan was silent for a moment as they
walked, visibly gathering his words. Eventually he said, "You can't be
gone."</p>

<p></p>

"I was gone for a while, son."


<p></p>

<p>"But you weren't <i>gone</i> gone.
They still held your position. Even before the Sansha rumors and the capsuleer
attacks, they wanted you back."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Kanen was impressed. Anyone who'd caused
the kind of accident he did would have been out on his ass. He certainly
wouldn't have spared any member of his own team if they'd done what he did.</p>

<p></p>

<p>He quelled that thought. It would only
lead to pride, and he had not earned that feeling. He hadn't even earned
relief, though he hoped the end of this walk, if Corwan ever let it end, would
help him on that path.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Corwan continued, "I won't get
pulled up while you're here. No one will."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Kanen considered this. "That's the
point, isn't it? You want me gone because I'm holding you back from promotion,
but even while I'm here, at least nobody else will get the job, either."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Corwan nodded miserably. "I, uh. I
need a bit more time to iron out some issues."</p>

<p></p>

"Some issues."


<p></p>

<p>"Some issues with the boss,"
Corwan said. "Just some... well, like I said, stuff I need to iron
out."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Make your position clear,"
Kanen said and couldn't help a little grin.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Yeah, Iâ€“" Corwan caught the
sarcasm. "Anyway, yes, I'd like you here so I don't lose out on a
promotion to someone else. But I'm also glad you're back."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Thanks," Kanen said. He
believed it. Corwan was a climber, but he wasn't dishonest, at least no more
than someone needed to be if they intended to make their way to the top by dint
of being too oily to hold back. "We'll talk about this later. I need to
see someone else now."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"All right. Thank you," Corwin
said. "And, uh. Welcome back."</p>

<p></p>

<p>The younger man walked off, leaving
Kanen to make the last of the trek alone. Despite himself, he couldn't but
appreciate Corwin's honesty. The problem with career climbers was that
everything they said tended to be tainted by want. There was the direct meaning
of their words, which was always clear and usually more than a little
flattering, and then there was the hidden one, the real motivation, which
involved their own desires and which you had to discern like you were looking
through a darkened glass. Having one of them break cover, as it were, was
something to cherish.</p>

<p></p>

<p>He passed a few others on the way, and
noticed the way they spotted him, but tried to ignore whatever they said.
Snippets of one conversation did pass through his filters.</p>

<p></p>

<i>That's him. Over there.</i>



<i>That dude?</i>



<i>That dude.</i>



<i>He's the one? The guy whoâ€“</i>....


<p></p>

<i>That's the one.</i>



<i>Oh. Wow.</i>


<p></p>

There was a pause.


<p></p>

<i>He's</i> old.


<p></p>

<p>Kanen grinned again, and marched towards
the personal quarters.</p>

<p></p>

<p>A knock on a particular door, a deep
breath, and when it was opened by a woman her eyes went wide and she slapped
him hard in the face.</p>

<p></p>

<p>He didn't raise his hand to his cheek,
though it felt on fire. Her nails had broken skin. "Hi, Beth," he
said.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"How dare you show up here?"
she said to him in a voice so quiet it approached a whisper.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Can I come in?" he asked.
When she made no move to let him in, he added, "Beth, I'm back. I am going
to be on the colony for some time."</p>

<p></p>

<p>She glared at him, her lips pinched
together. Then she stepped aside without a word. Kanen walked in past her, into
the living room, and sat down on a couch.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It was a sizeable living room. The
apartment was meant for two people.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I don't have a lot to say,"
Kanen said to her as she walked into the room. She did not sit.</p>

<p></p>

<p>He added, "Not as much as I'm sure
you'd like to say to me. Nothing's going to help much. I just wanted to let you
know I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart, and that I'm trying to make
amends."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"By coming here?" She stared
at him. "You think you're making amends by coming back... here?"</p>

<p></p>

"I was asked to come backâ€“"


<p></p>

"By who?"


<p></p>

<p>"Saraanen. He needs people right
now, and I've recuperated enough."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"That's nice. That's nice. I'm glad
someone has."</p>

<p></p>

"Beth, Iâ€“"


<p></p>

<p>"My husband nearly <i>died</i>
because of you."</p>

<p></p>

"If I could do anything for Jâ€“"


<p></p>

<p>"Don't say his name! Don't you say
his name. He was seriously hurt." She looked away for the first time.
"He's still in there, on his white bed in that horrible room, and he
nearly died. They won't even let me see him except on weekends."</p>

<p></p>

<p>"Has he ... come back at all?"
Kanen asked.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"A couple of times. We spoke a
little, but he drifted off. They think it might be all right some day but we
don't know when, and the brain injuries mean he might not be able to..."
Her voice sputtered, then failed her. She breathed deeply. "Why did you
return? What can there possibly be left here for you, except more people to
hurt?"</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I don't know, Beth. Some way to
show I'm not a tired old man who's lost it for good and who puts his friends in
terrible danger," he said. It was an honest thing to say, or at least it
felt that way to him, and for the first time in their
talk she met his gaze with something that didn't resemble hatred. </p>

<p></p>

<p>He got up. "I didn't want to make
this long. Just wanted to let you know, before you heard from anyone else, or
saw me around. I won't be getting in your way. But if he gets better, I do hope
you will let me know. I really do."</p>

<p></p>

<p>He turned and walked to the door.
"Take care, Beth," he said before leaving her quarters.</p>

<p></p>

<p align="center" style="text-align:center">***</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><i>You know you have to go when you
start to fail, little by little. The final break that pushes you out - which
will always be terrible, and far more costly to other people than it was to you
- is not some single event, some great explosion that is isolated from
everything else. Not a single grand failure but a cascade of smaller ones that
you just can't grasp, no more than the pebbles falling through your hands. They
add up and they keep adding up in a monstrous framework of dangerous failure
until finally, by some banal coincidence, something finally tips the whole
thing over.</i></p>

<i>Â </i>


<i>And people get hurt.</i>


<i>Â </i>


<p><i>All those little mistakes, the ones
you wouldn't have made if you weren't so </i>tired<i>,
and you want to say: It wasn't me. This is not how I live my life. This
terrible wreckage, this is not the work of a man like me. But you only think
like that after the fact, and by that time you can no longer attract attention
to what you did. You are advised, by those few who will still talk to you when
you surface as a human being again, to 'let go of the past.' Let go of the past
and 'live in the now.' Never mind that my past includes several decades of </i>not<i>
fucking up, before everything started to slide, and that my Now involves an old
man about to work on a ratty piece of equipment on the hard edge of a rock
floating in deadly nullsec. To hell with the Now. I'd live in the past if I
could; the view is infinitely better.</i></p>

<p></p>

<p align="center" style="text-align:center">***</p>

<p></p>

<p>He walked on. He didn't know what was
driving him on: atonement or sheer stubbornness. There was one person who
wanted him here, one who wasn't sure, and one who wanted him dead and gone. If
he did this, it wouldn't be noble, but it wouldn't be for a debased reason,
either. It involved pride and selfishness, yes; but mostly, he suspected, it
involved the need to do something â€“ anything â€“ with the rest of his time other
than watch it pass him by.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As he passed into the corridors that
would lead him to the changing rooms, he saw, through the glass alloy walls,
the world outside this place. There were asteroid mountains in the distance,
and beyond them, the sun shining bright. He felt the thrum of the earthworks as
he walked on and on. And every face, even those who resented him here - and
there were plenty - still showed a grudging respect, if only for the fact that
he had lasted this long; he lasted this long and he returned.</p>

<p></p>

<p>He walked on, losing track of time. The
harness of his old machine was there; he could see it now. It was empty. It was
waiting for him.</p>
