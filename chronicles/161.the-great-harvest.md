# The Great Harvest

From afar the Blood Raiders watched the death of their   little hunters. The Sisters of EVE ship they had been ordered to trail had   sealed its fate at the largest drone hive Antar had ever seen.
  

It was an amazing sight. The Sisters ship, which had   lain still for a while, moved in and was immediately targeted by the drones. A   few of the monstrous machines approached it, and apparently engaged in some kind   of dialogue. The Raiders didn't catch any transmissions, but since the drones   hadn't started murdering anyone, Antar reasoned they must be busy keeping up the   conversation.
  

Not long after, the drones started moving again,   closing in on the Sisters ship like a trapped prey and literally tearing it to   pieces. The last that Antar's team saw of the ship before the drones completely   enveloped it was a glimpse of its starboard side, which looked like a hunk of   twisted metal.
  

Part of Antar's team had laughed and whooped - you   didn't last long as a Blood Raider if you couldn't take joy in terror - but it   was nervous laughter, tempered by worry of what would happen to them. Someone   asked Antar whether they would be going the same way, and he grabbed the chance   to instill calm in the crew.
  

"Hell if we are. Get me HQ," he said, with ridiculous   bravado. "Someone wanted us here and they can damn well explain what this is all   about."
  

It took the communications crewmember a lot longer   than usual to get a response from the Raider base. For a moment Antar wondered   whether he, too, had been led here as some kind of prey. He had to admit to   himself that it would not be a disappointment. He had played the pious worshiper   and the exuberant hedonist, and in some of his long nights he had wondered what   would happen once he had filled in all the gaps of his soul. Better to be   sacrificed while it meant something, even if only to his enemies, than to be   extinguished for no reason at all.
  

The crewman waved at him, snapping him out of his   reverie.
  

"HQ, are you there?" Antar said.
  

A voice said, "Hold, please."
  

Antar raised an eyebrow at the crewman, who shrugged   and raised his hands, palms up.
  

Shortly after, another voice sounded out from the   speakers. It was a crackly, raspy little thing and gave Antar the chills.   "Greetings, Raiders! You have no idea how lucky you are."
  

The captain recognized the voice, but couldn't recall   where from. "Can you state your credentials, please?" he said, in an even tone   that he kept devoid of any challenge.
  

"Certainly, captain. My name is Omir Sarakusa. A long   time ago an Amarrian group of heretics struck out for fortune and glory under   the title of Sani Sabik. I am a leader of one of their branches, a group called   the Blood Raiders. You may have heard of us."
  

Antar's stomach turned to ice. Every face on the   bridge turned to look at him. "Sir, this is an honor. It truly is."
  

"That's nice, Captain," the voice said, and Antar   could swear there was something in it that felt utterly inhuman, "But right now   I'd like to hear your tactical assessment of the situation."
  

"Sir, we're looking at a hive of rogue drones - quite   a monstrosity, actually - and mere moments ago we saw them tear apart the   Sisters vessel that we'd been instructed to follow. Whatever its captain was   after, he took the wrong path there."
  

"That's a shame, Captain. I was just about to ask you   to go the same route."
  

Antar truly did not know whether there was humor or   seriousness in Sarakusa's tone. He tried not to think of the fact that madness,   which was very much a theme of the Blood Raider life, often combined the two.
  

"What are your thoughts, Captain?"
  

"That I had better get my affairs in order, sir,"   Antar risked.
  

"Do you have any other course of action to propose?"
  

"Well, sir," Antar said, "My crew and I are Blood   Raiders to the core and I can't honestly say that we fear death. But given the   choice, I'd prefer that it not be meaningless. I presume I was told to come here   for a reason, and I also presume there's something on the other side of those   mad machines that's worth retrieving."
  

"This is true, Captain. Go on."
  

"We have never spoken before, sir, but from the barely   concealed amusement in your voice I suspect that you know what's out there and   how to get it. But for what it's worth, my course of action, if we are to get   past these murderous drones at all, is to call in an armada of Blood Raiders and   anyone else who'll support us, and bring the fire to those metal beasts."
  

"That's not a bad plan, Captain. Given your current   intel, I expect it's the only one that makes sense."
  

"That would be an accurate summation. Sir."
  

"Here is why it wouldn't work. The thing that lies on   the other side of these drones, a machine that the Sisters were after, is much   valued and highly desired by almost every power in Empire and beyond. Merely   amassing a fleet would attract far too much attention before we're ready. A   burst attack on the drone facility would do the same, but we'd never get that   far, because as soon as everyone saw what was on the other side they would tear   through their own people to get there first."
  

"Sir, what <i>is</i> on the other side?"
  

"Jamyl Sarum's superweapon, son. The end of the   world."
  

The Captain stood there, speechless.
  

"We have friends, Captain, who have greatly   facilitated us in this process. They have spies within the Sisters' ranks - in   fact, they have even clashed with the Sisters on past hunts for strange relics,   though none so magnificent as this one - and they were perfectly happy with   letting the Sisters show us the way to the weapon. I will put you in direct   contact with them quite shortly. You are to obey their instructions to the   letter. If you do so, I have reason to believe that this quest of yours will end   with you manning the greatest destructive weapon known to mankind. Do you   understand what that means, Captain?"
  

Antar saw it, in his mind's eye. The weapon,   surrounded by an armada of his people, making its way into Empire space like   poison into a vein. Hovering over other ships, space stations, cities on   planets, and laying waste to everything in sight. Millions of people, billions,   wiped out with unstoppable force. It would be the greatest harvest the sect had   ever seen. The grandest slaughter in the entirety of human history. They would   lay waste to the life before them. It would be the culmination of the Blood   Raiders' existence; the achievement of all their goals. The end of the road.
  

"I understand, sir," he said, and he did, beyond all   measure.
  

"I detect some doubt in your voice, Captain, even over   this great distance. Do you have any compunction about the incredible harvest   that this weapon will grant us?"
  

He did. "None whatsoever, sir." He did not mind the   carnage in the slightest. It was something else preying on his mind entirely,   but now was not the place.
  

"Then you know how important it is that everything go   according to plan. Again, obey our friends' instructions and you will get out of   this not only in one piece, but a hero of the Sani Sabik."
  

"Yes, sir."
  

The line cut off.
  

Shortly after, they were hailed again. A new voice   spoke, one that was unknown to the captain. It felt emotionless and dead. It   said, "Are you listening?"
  

"Yes, Antar said.
  

The voice said, "We will upload to your ship an   extensive packet of data. Once you have accepted its delivery you will fully   verify its integrity, for any errors will kill you and cost us the entire   mission. This data bulk is an access key that will alter the drones'   programming, resetting it to its original state, and thus grant you safe   passage. We entrust you with this because we cannot be seen in this area, but we   will expect recompense. Once you have secured the weapon, you will bring it to a   named location for us to inspect. We are interested in the theory of the thing,   not its use."
  

And in reproducing it, I'm sure, Antar thought, but   said nothing.
  

The voice continued, "Once we have finished our   inspection, the weapon will be free for your faction to use in whatever way you   wish. You may use the drones as necessary to resupply you with fuel. You should   understand that any attempt to violate the terms of this agreement, such as by   failing to bring the ship in time to the assigned location, will have disastrous   consequences for you and your faction."
  

"You're going to booby-trap it, aren't you?" Antar   said, less as a question than a resigned statement.
  

"Of course," the voice said, less as an answer than an   obvious statement of fact. "It will already be rigged in some fashion, but the   drones will take care of that. Instead of disabling the traps, they will render   control to us. We get the weapon, or no one does."
  

"How can we trust that you will not betray us?" Antar   said. This, too, was not a question, but he felt it needed to be said, if only   so his crew would know he had thought this far.
  

"You can't, obviously," the voice said. "But you can   very much trust us to explode the vessel if you fail. Prepare for acceptance of   the data string. And bring the ship to the wrecked station by planet ten, moon   two in the Roua system."
  

The transmission ended. Someone in his crew said,   "That's a ... Society of Conscious Thought area, sir."
  

The captain closed his eyes. "So it is," he said.
  

He heard the navigator say, "Data transmitting, sir,"   and nodded his acceptance.
  

Shortly after the ship moved forward, toward the   massive hive. The drones immediately targeted and engaged.
  

The ship transmitted its data, and for a quiet moment   Antar thought with perverse relief that they were still doomed to die.
  

His thoughts changed to puzzled amazement when the   nearest drones suddenly disengaged, stopped dead in their tracks and started   orbiting the ship as if they were protecting it. He had the navigator pull up a   wide picture of the drone hive, and the sight was amazing. It was as if a wave   of cognitive dissonance was sweeping over the poor machines. The ones that had   been heading towards the ship went every which way, some back to the hive,   others towards the blue star in the distance, and a fair few in directions that   seemed utterly random. Others, mainly the drones that had been carrying isogen-5   to the hive, apparently sped up their efforts, zooming back and forth with such   fervor that a fair few missed the hangar entrance and crashed into the hive   walls. A handful of drones even flew into one another and began to fight, only   to break up again a moment later and head their separate ways.
  

Antar saw how most of the drones - the ones not   holding isogen-5, at least - kept opening and closing their claws, as if   grasping at empty air. Against his communicator's advice he attempted to hail   them, but there was no response. He suspected the drones were not incapable of   communication, but merely too busy dealing with their new programming to answer   at all.
  

He felt he could sense their personalities, bubbling   through the chaos. They seemed very puzzled at the change and not at all pleased   with it. A new conscience, ages in the making, might now have suddenly been   yanked back to start, like a dog who'd only just learned to roam before the   leash was put on with a vengeance. He noticed how even some of the isogen-5   transport drones, who had apparently continued with their tasks unabated, would   stop every now and then, as if trying to shake off the effects, before returning   to their fixed routines.
  

As his ship approached the Abaddon, other thoughts of   boiling panic and despair began floating to the top of his mind. This was the   culmination of his life's work, the final filling in the gap that would   supposedly make him whole, and while he had no compunction about the reign of   terror he was about to unleash, he was beginning to fear and loathe every minute   of it.
