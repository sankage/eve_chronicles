# Present Pieces

![Present Pieces](images/Present_Pieces.jpg)
<i><span>A Beginning</span></i><p>
    <span>In the darkness, someone inhaled audibly; a faint speck of 
    red flared, just for a moment, some twenty feet away. There was a pause and then 
    a long, sharp exhalation from the shadows near the wall. The smell of tobacco 
    grew strong in the air. A pause, another drag. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Abruptly, the smoker started coughing, quietly at first, but 
    growing louder and harder, a grating crescendo in the yard's murky, almost 
    artificial silence. Amid gasping attempts to catch his breath, the man muttered 
    a few unintelligible words. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>From the tone, Chieran thought none of the words were fit for 
    young ears. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Sounds bad. You might consider having that looked at," he 
    interjected, voice carefully measured, neutral but friendly. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The smoker paused only for a moment, biting back his next 
    cough, before replying. "You figure there's any way I could
    <i>not</i> be looked at in this place?" The 
    response was bitter, but not overtly hostile. He swallowed another cough. "I'm 
    sure there's some nurse watching us with multispecs from one of those windows up 
    there right now. Big needle in her hand, probably, just waiting for me to go 
    back inside. Or a bloody bonesaw, more likely." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>His smirk hidden by the darkness, Chieran forced out a short 
    laugh. "You the fellow from 216-B? The one they brought down from the LTT the 
    other day?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Might be." The coughing man's voice was suddenly tight. He 
    was young, much younger than Chieran had first thought. Barely out of his teens. 
    The young man took another drag of his cigarette. "Why?" he asked sharply. And 
    then he started coughing again. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran waited for the spasm to pass, and then there was 
    another silence as each man waited for the other to resume. After a few long 
    seconds, the lit stub of a cigarette launched itself in a spinning arc through 
    the darkness, flaring into a tiny explosion when it hit the ground. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran spoke again. "I'm in 219, across the way. That's all. 
    Just wondering." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>There was another silence, this one considerably shorter. 
    "Yeah, well, I don't remember being brought in there. Don't remember much till 
    last night, actually. Guess the drugs wore off by then. Couldn't sleep. And I 
    didn't much feel like coming out here for a smoke until now. Smoke and a little 
    peace and quiet." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Well, the peace and quiet's good. Not so much the smoking. 
    But I won't tell anyone." He paused deliberately for comic effect. "Besides, the 
    nurse with the 'specs already knows anyway." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Shit," the stranger replied, a faint hint of laughter in his 
    voice as he choked out the word, stifling yet another cough. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Well, listen," Chieran said, assuming that the other man did 
    not want company. "I'm sure you need your rest. I know I do. And besides, it's a 
    bit chilly out here. Perhaps I'll see you again tomorrow." And without waiting 
    for a reply, he turned and reached for the door handle. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><span>An Earlier Beginning</p></span></i>

  <p>
    <span>"Chieran― Dr. Kenitawri… you really need to see this. I 
    think― I have― I've found something interesting. Quite interesting." The image 
    on Chieran's desk shuddered for a moment as Dr. Merial Akalayan, his senior 
    assistant, shifted her holocam downward and expanded the view to include two 
    objects, each filling half of a large table. "This piece was recently brought 
    back from a wormhole in Akora. <i>This</i> 
    piece," she said, pointing to the second object, "was found in the archive. 
    Labeled, probably by some idiotic student, as 'detritus.' It was retrieved from 
    a very old excavation site on Matari Prime ― Matar, I mean ― sometime during the 
    last century. Never properly dated." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>At a glance, the two items seemed vaguely similar in shape, 
    but without examining them more closely, Chieran could not judge accurately.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Yes, and what is it that's so interesting?" Chieran asked.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Well, several things," the younger scientist replied, her 
    voice speeding up. "First, the age. I ran some tests, and the first object dates 
    back roughly fourteen to fifteen thousand years; the second, this one here, only 
    about slightly less, probably within less than a thousand years of the other."
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran's slightly raised eyebrow gave away his sudden 
    interest. "So late Yan Jung Era or shortly thereafter." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Yes. Precisely. Yes, and also, there's the matter of these 
    smaller sections here." She gestured to a series of protrusions on both objects, 
    both worn with rust but still easily visible. "On both, these nodes appear in 
    the same pattern, which was what first lead me to look more closely." She paused 
    again, breathing deeply, and her voice, when she continued, was shaking with 
    excitement. "Chieran, I think these… I am almost certain, but I need to run some 
    more tests, naturally. But I think― well, and of course I'd want you to have a 
    look at―" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran smiled as he interrupted. "Merial, please. I trust 
    your judgment. For now, just tell me what you're thinking." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Merial laughed nervously. "Yes, yes, I'm sorry. I just… well, 
    you know. Chieran, this is big. I mean potentially incredibly huge. And I just 
    don't want to make any mistakes." She drew a deep breath and started again. 
    "Okay, so, these patterns of nodes on both of them ― Chieran, they're 
    essentially <i>just</i> like big fractal 
    acceleration shell capacitors. I've triple-checked the alignments." She breathed 
    deeply again, obviously agitated. "I think these things, both of them, they're 
    some kind of old acceleration shell equalizers. But it's the
    <i>size</i>! I mean, with equalizers this 
    big, the engines themselves would have to have been, well, absolutely enormous. 
    I mean, a ship that could house an engine this size must have been…
    <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>Well, no modern dreadnought could even 
    compare!"</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran felt a chill down his spine. The hands of fate, he 
    sensed, very firmly gripped his shoulders. He was not entirely surprised, and he 
    could feel the goosebumps spreading down his arms. Something had told him, when 
    he asked his most trusted researcher to spend weeks going through virtually 
    abandoned archives ― a job far beneath her place, and for which she had not 
    initially been at all grateful ― that there was a good reason. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Okay, not a word of this to anyone. Does anyone else know?" 
    Merial shook her head. "Alright, I mean it, not anyone. I will take the redline 
    chute and be there in 5 minutes." She met his gaze through the holo conference, 
    still seeming unsure of herself. Chieran was reassuring. "And Merial...? Good 
    work. I'll see you in a minute." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Before he had finished his last words, the desktop holo was 
    already fading, the connection at his end flipped with a hurried gesture. He 
    could not walk quickly enough. This accidental discovery might just be the 
    missing connection to the very research in which he had invested the past 
    twenty-nine years of his life. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>He had always known this honor would come to him. Everything, 
    everything he knew, happened for a reason. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <i><span>Present Company</p></span></i>

  <p>
    <span>Chieran knocked lightly on the doorframe, his grizzled face 
    already peeking around to inspect the room. "Well, I see you're awake." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Uh, yeah. I'm up. What…? Are you a doctor?" the young man 
    responded. Without the surrounding shadows of the dusky courtyard, he looked as 
    young as his voice had made him sound the night before. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Ha! Insightful question! Yes, I am, in fact, a doctor. 
    Although I'm not a <i>medical</i> doctor. I'm 
    not <i>your</i> doctor, if that's what you're 
    asking." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"I see. Well, what… I mean, why are you here, then?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Can I ask your name, if you don't mind? It does make 
    conversing so much easier, I've always found." There was a certain joyous 
    mischief about Chieran, both in his voice and his expression. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The young man took a few breaths, bemused despite himself, 
    before answering. "It's Kestor." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Good to meet you, Kestor. I am Chieran, and it is a pleasure 
    to meet you. Again, that is." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"You're the guy from last night in the courtyard. I kind of 
    thought I had dreamt that, to be honest. So if you're not a doctor ― I mean, if 
    you're not an M.D. ― then why are you here?" A sudden thought occurred to him. 
    "You some kind of psych or something?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Oh, my goodness, most certainly not," Chieran replied with a 
    short laugh. "How tedious that would be. The things in some people's heads are 
    interesting, but I most certainly wouldn't want to see everything in everyone's 
    head. Dreadful. No, I prefer conversation to behavior modification." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"So why are you here, then?"</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>"As I said, I enjoy conversation. And the ceiling in my room 
    is not entirely forthcoming, despite my many efforts to persuade it." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"No, I mean, why are you in this hospital?" Kestor asked, not 
    entirely sure how to react to the odd old man. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Oh, it's nothing, I assure you. Just a minor problem with 
    blood pressure that they assure me they have now repaired. I assume I'll be out 
    in a few days, once they've had a chance to observe me a bit longer." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"But if they repaired it, you're fine, right? I mean… why 
    would they need to observe you at all? You are talking gene therapy?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Yes, and that would be the case normally. But it seems that 
    I am important enough to bear watching. Just in case there might have been some 
    problem with the procedure. And so I am here, chatting with you. For a short 
    time, at least." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Kestor pondered this, keeping his eyes locked on Chieran, 
    trying to read the truth of his words. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"So, what happened to you, may I ask? Zipper crash?" Chieran 
    asked. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Kestor decided that the old man seemed relatively harmless, 
    and his answer came more quickly this time. Quickly ― and more harshly than he 
    had intended. "Oh, no. No accident. I had some words with a couple of Dropheads 
    that always set up near the new Arts Center, where my sister goes to school. 
    They said we aren't <i>local</i> enough and 
    were giving her a hard time. When I told them to back off, they, uh… they put 
    the damned boots to me." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"I see. That's terrible. I'm sorry. Your sister, is she 
    alright?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"She's fine. She was in earlier to visit, actually. For a 
    little while, at least. She doesn't like…" He paused for just an instant, 
    glancing off to one side before going on. "Uh, doesn't like hospitals that much. 
    Anyway, they ran off after they beat me up, I guess, afraid someone would catch 
    them." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran sensed that there was more to the story, perhaps, but 
    that Kestor was reticent to talk about it. He changed subjects. "So what does 
    that mean? Not 'local enough'? You moved here recently?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"No, I've lived here my whole life." The young man's face 
    shifted to a sneer as he continued, quite unconsciously. "My dad's a Godlover. 
    Even wears those stupid robes all the time." The anger Chieran sensed the 
    previous night had returned to Kestor's voice, and he twitched involuntarily, 
    shaking the holo control in his hand. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran absorbed the change in Kestor's demeanor. "I see. 
    And, how did he…? Is he Nefantar, your father?" he asked, somewhat puzzled.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Nefantar?" the young man snorted. "No. That'd be easier. No, 
    my grand-dad was a slave on some Amarr bastard's mining colony in Ammatar space 
    up till just after my dad was born. Born a slave, but he was set free by some
    <i>amazing</i> battleship captain who came in 
    and tore the place up." The scorn in his voice was thick. "Well, grand-dad must 
    have learned his slave lessons real well, 'cause even after he was set free, he 
    raised my dad to be a Godlover too." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"I take it you don't care much for your grandfather?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"You <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">kidding</i>? He was―" He broke off in a bitter laugh. "No, I did not care 
    much for my grandfather. He was a miserable old bastard. I'm glad he's dead. And 
    my dad's not much better." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>***</p></span></i>

  <p>
    <i><span>In Pieces</p></span></i>

  <p>
    <span>Ziather sighed, reaching down to pick up the last few pieces 
    of sheerite lying at his feet. The transparent glasslike surface of the broken 
    nano-alloy bits, much harder than normal glass, glittered almost warmly in the 
    soft morning light. As he bent, his back creaked ominously, and he had to 
    suppress a shudder at the idea of undergoing another spinal treatment. A 
    wealthier man might have had new cells injected to rejuvenate the tissue, but 
    people who lived in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">pidouk</i> could not afford such luxuries. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>Don't dwell on what you 
    do not have,</span></i><span> he recited for perhaps the fourth 
    time since waking. It was a belief so deeply part of him, a kind of passive 
    contentment bordering on ontological dejection, that a complete stranger could 
    have read it from his posture alone. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">I have a home and I am a free man, and that should be enough, </i>he 
    thought. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Just then, Cliemne called from the back room, "I'm going, 
    papa." The sound of the door closing behind her should have pre-empted any 
    response. The door was not shut gently. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Always in such a hurry," Ziather spoke aloud.
    <i>Even when she was small, always so 
    hurried. Always running off somewhere. </i></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>He turned to throw the broken bits of sheerite into the waste 
    unit, still moving slowly, as always, but then bit back a curse. In spite of his 
    careful grip, a razor-sharp bit of the hardened polymer had jabbed his hand, and 
    he looked down to see a tiny spot of blood growing in the soft flesh between his 
    middle two fingers. The old man ― he really wasn't terribly old, but that's how 
    he thought of himself ― grew even more contemplative at the sight of the blood, 
    as if entranced by the dance of an open flame or the gleam of sunlight on the 
    sea. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The argument had started, as they always did, when Ziather 
    had made an innocent comment about his son's behavior at school having improved 
    this past semester. Kestor was strong-minded, as Ziather's father had been, and 
    his moods were as mercurial as the weather here in Shishaan. And like his 
    grandfather, Kestor nettled at any accusation of wrongdoing, past or present. 
    But this morning Ziather had made the mistake of pointing that similarity out.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Before Kestor stormed out, he had snatched up the holopic of 
    his grandfather and smashed it three times against the stone counter until it 
    shattered. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>He stared at the blood on his palm, now a rich red pearl, and 
    drifted deeper into thought. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>What is it that we see 
    in our loved ones that we hate? Is it the things we fail to see in ourselves? Or 
    what we </span></i><span>do<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> see? <p></p></i></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>Yes, Father was hard. 
    Bitter. He was a cold man. But he </span></i><span>had<i> to be. What a life, the life of a slave. 
    Yet he loved Kestor more fiercely than he ever felt about anything, I think. 
    About me, even. Yes, that is true. We were never kindred spirits. But those two, 
    they are so much alike. They </i>were<i> so 
    much alike. When Kestor smashed the holopic, I thought, </i>
    <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Stop! Stop, you are only breaking <i>
    yourself</i> open.</b><i> But I cannot stop 
    him. I just do not know. I don't know my son. <p></p></i></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>Even darling Clem sees 
    it. She tries to make Kestor understand, to help him see that our lives are 
    precious, not to be wasted. What sort of a father am I?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>How can I let this happen again and 
    again? And Cliemne, just staring down silently as her brother and I shout at 
    each other? So beautiful, she is. Like a jewel, a brilliant, dancing jewel. Just 
    like her mother, God bless her. <p></p></span></i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>But Kestor… he is… 
    well, he is too like his grandfather. I do not know him. <p></p></span></i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>What am I to do? My 
    son, so bright, so talented, and he does nothing but throw it away with those 
    friends of his, all worthless. No futures, no plans. He hates me and my faith, 
    but he thrashes about like a drowning man. Crying out for meaning, but silently, 
    not even knowing he cries. Wanting love, the divine love, more surely than 
    anyone I have known. The more I try to calm him, to reassure him ― to </span>
    </i><span>teach<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> him ― the farther he draws away. And for all my faith, I have no answers. <p></p>
    </i></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>I have no answers. <p></p>
    </span></i>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Ziather sat down at the table and stared absently at the 
    plate his daughter had left on the table. He noticed just then that her meal was 
    untouched. A silent tear gathered in his eye. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i><span>My God, give me the 
    answers.</p></span></i>

  <p align="center" style="text-align:center">
    <span>***</span></p>
  <p>
    <i><span>Moving Forward</p></span></i>

  <p>
    <span>Chieran, not wanting to open old wounds any further, but 
    wanting to get Kestor to talk more, changed the subject once again. It was a 
    disarming tactic he had found eminently useful both in the workplace and 
    elsewhere. "The ones who beat you up, were they taken in?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"I have no idea. I just remember somebody hitting me, and 
    then I was on the ground, and there was a pair of feet, and then everything was 
    black. Next thing I know, I wake up in my bed here. And Clem just said they ran 
    away. She didn't say if they were caught." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"I see. Well, at least you're in one piece, now, more or 
    less. The doctors here really are among the best. We must always be thankful for 
    something." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Oh, yeah, I'm so thankful." The young man's voice was a 
    study in sarcasm. "Yes. I'm really thankful those pricks didn't have someplace 
    else to be. Yeah, I just have so much to be thankful for." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran, always sensitive to moods, tried to calm Kestor with 
    reason. It had always worked for himself, a safe retreat when emotions ran high. 
    That and humor. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Listen, Kestor, you have every right to be angry. I 
    understand that. I'd be angry, too, in your place. But I
    <i>am</i> thankful you're alive, as I'm sure 
    your family is too. And I'm also glad that, unlike your great grandfather, you 
    are here, living among your own people ― even if not everyone here feels the 
    same way I do, like the young men who attacked you." He deliberated carefully 
    before speaking his next words. "There is purpose in everything." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Oh, hell. Now you sound just like my dad." Kestor's legs 
    slithered against the bed coverings as he shifted, getting ready to stand up.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Well, perhaps your father is wiser than you realize. I'm 
    sure he's thankful that you're alive. How could he not? The father's place is in 
    caring for the son." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Okay, what are you, some kind of priest? Seriously. Doctor 
    of religion or something?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"A priest?" Chieran chuckled. "No, I'm a scientist, actually. 
    But I like to think the two are quite close, to be honest. If you really want to 
    know, I work for Starship Research and Development at Core Complexion, 
    specializing in ancient technologies research." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Kestor's attitude changed to awed curiosity almost as quickly 
    as he had grown angry earlier. "Seriously? That's… whoa, that's pretty damned 
    cool." A sudden thought came to him. "But don't you guys have your own special 
    hospitals and stuff? With, like, the best specialist doctors and, you know, 
    super-advanced AIMEDs and stuff?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Where do you think you are right now, young man? You hadn't 
    wondered at the speed of your recovery? Two days, and nearly back to yourself. 
    Your attack was politically quite significant, you know. The son of a former 
    slave, returned to Matar, and yet the victim of such a crime in one of our 
    greatest cities? Nearly killed by his own people? Important people are sparing 
    no expense to make sure you recover unblemished." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Kestor was stunned. "You… Really? Wow. I―" For the first time 
    since they had met, Kestor was at a loss for words. </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>The bioturb sliced through the east side of Uptown, all 
    movement almost indiscernible to its passengers as it hummed along several 
    inches above its single fine rail. Inertial gyrodiffusers shimmered hazily in 
    the morning light, giving the elongated car what seemed an otherworldly gleam to 
    anyone not accustomed to planetside life in a place as advanced as Sivaralad.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Inside, Cliemne sat with her bag resting almost carelessly on 
    her knees. However, her arms, drawn protectively around it, gave the lie to her 
    seeming unconcern. Inside the bag were her school books and her lunch, but more 
    importantly ― far more importantly ― her shoes. In those shoes, she would dance 
    into a new life. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Ever since the new government, under Shakor, had introduced 
    the arts scholarships and ordered the construction of new arts centers and 
    programs through the Republic, Cliemne had known that she would have a place. 
    For as long as she could recall, dance had been her one passion, the one place 
    she could go to find beauty and tranquility, whatever her mood when she first 
    got to class. And since she had won the scholarship, the old dreams had 
    returned, but they were in vivid color now. It was, she knew, a sign. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>When she was small and the dreams came, they had always been 
    nightmares, colorless vistas, her floating away into a cold, gray sky. And 
    always, when she awoke, pale and sweating, she had felt a tremendous sense of 
    loss and terror. She had never spoken of them. But the dreams gradually went 
    away as she got older; suddenly, in just the past few months, they had returned. 
    Yet they were joyful things now, bright and warm, filled with a sense of soaring 
    off, to a happier place, one where she would be welcomed into loving arms. Into 
    the arms of a mother she had never known. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>So far, she had to admit, the dream had not taken her that 
    far. The welcoming arms were always just beyond the horizon. But Clem knew, with 
    the single-minded certainty of youth, that she would reach them soon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>And by some intuition, she knew that 
    the dream and the dance were intricately connected. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The Shishaan Center for the Performing Arts, now that its 
    construction was complete, represented the beginning of a new life for Clem, 
    away from her father and her brother and their endless bickering. Even in 
    appearance, the Center stood in stark contrast to her home. Its massive, high 
    towers with their peaked summits, made almost entirely of glimmering sheerite, 
    with the brightly waving banners, the happy laughter of the students ― these 
    could not have been more different than the endless smelly, dirty streets and 
    alleys of the pidouk, the Drop-dealers and the gangs and the prostitutes and the 
    endless procession of drunks and dead-eyed, miserable wanderers. </span>
  </p>
  <p style="tab-stops:341.2pt">
    <span>If, as her father said, there was a hell, then the pidouk was 
    part of it. <span style="mso-tab-count:
1">            </span></span>
  </p>
  <p style="tab-stops:341.2pt">
    <span>But Cliemne was on her way to a new world, both here in 
    Shishaan and in her dreams. And soon, so very soon now that she could taste the 
    moment, she would fly away from her godforsaken old life and land somewhere 
    else, a place where the beauty and the tranquility would always be with her. 
    Where she would never have to listen to father and Kestor fight again. Never 
    have to see the squalor and the pain or listen to the shouts and curses. Where 
    she and her mother and the dream would become one. </span>

    <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>Reification</p></span></i>

  <p>
    <span>Kestor was due to be released this afternoon. It was more 
    than welcome. Even just a few days in bed were wearing on him. But Chieran had 
    proven pleasant company, making Kestor laugh more than he could remember having 
    laughed in a long time. At least with anyone other than his friends. And, with 
    them, there was always an ugly sense of competition in their jokes, and a kind 
    of cruelty. Chieran, though, simply seemed to enjoy laughing and making others 
    laugh. There was no dark underside to it. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>They were coming to the end of what would likely be their 
    last conversation, searching for things to say, when Chieran suddenly became 
    serious. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Kestor, I happen to believe that everything happens for a 
    reason. Each of us has a part to play in something much bigger than we can see." 
    Kestor remained silent. "There is a reason we're having this conversation right 
    now. A reason we found ourselves here in this place at the same time." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Whoa. Are you trying to hit on me now? Man, I have to admit, 
    I didn't see that one coming." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieran's laugh was generous. "My friend, the doctors here 
    have done a remarkable job of rebuilding you from the broken pieces, so, given 
    that I'm not feeling any attraction of the sort, I'm afraid you just must not 
    have been that handsome to begin with. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"No," he continued, again growing uncharacteristically 
    serious, given his manner of the past days. "But I'm trying to say that it is 
    not coincidence, perhaps, that we were both brought here at the same time and 
    placed across the hall from each other." Kestor snorted, still looking 
    skeptical. "Please, let me finish. You've talked about your studies, and it's 
    obvious to me that, despite your scorn for the institution, you have a quick 
    mind." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"So you think that you're supposed to become my teacher or 
    something?" Kestor was having fun now, but at Chieron's expense. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Be quiet and let me finish." The older man had grown so 
    stern suddenly, so authoritative, that Kestor could not have spoken if he had 
    wanted to. It was almost unnatural, the change. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chieron nodded, satisfied that Kestor was suitably cowed. "I 
    am saying that, if you keep hating your life and your father and everything else 
    around you, keep holding yourself down instead of working to improve things, you 
    will never be happy. And that maybe I'm here to help you understand that. Your 
    future does not have to be constrained by your past, Kestor." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Kestor thought for a long moment. His face was impassive, but 
    Chieron could see the turmoil in his eyes. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"And you think it's that easy? I just walk out of here, and 
    magically everything changes for me?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Nothing comes easily, but you have a good mind. With work 
    and discipline, yes, everything changes." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Because everything has a reason, you think? It's just too 
    easy. It's like my dad thinking everything will work out because 'god' says it 
    will. According to you, too, just like him, there must be a reason he was born a 
    captive to some sadistic bastards. Who brainwashed him into believing in a god 
    who supports the slavery of entire races? That kind of 'reason'?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"I choose to believe so, yes. I don't pretend to understand 
    it, but I believe it. Not in a god, but in a greater purpose." Chieran's gaze 
    was steely, but kind. "And as for your father, whatever his beliefs, he is a 
    product of his environment, just as you and I are. Remember that. His religion 
    may have been imposed, but he has eyes to see the world around him. Hate the 
    environment that created him, but don't hate the man himself." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Well, I <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">do</i> hate him!" Kestpor screamed. "And the ones who did that to him, who 
    made him so, so… so pliable, and weak, and stupid. I just wish I could kill 
    those bastards. Every last one of them. Women, children. Fucking slaughter them 
    all." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Kestor, who would be the monsters if we did that? Do you 
    really think there are no people in all of Amarr who are troubled by what their 
    religion has sewn? Just as there are those among our own people who question the 
    decrees of the Sanmatar's tribal council, or who questioned Midular's policies?"
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Sensing the young man's vulnerability, Chieran pressed on. 
    "Or what about those who would harm their countrymen because they seem 
    different, the way you were hurt, despite the fact that we, as a nation, pride 
    ourselves on accepting and maintaining the differences between the Seven Tribes? 
    Good and bad, wrong and right, we don't have any monopolies. But we can have 
    faith that it will change." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Kestor was distraught, fighting back tears, red-faced, angry 
    and yet not wanting to fight. He was seeking answers, an answer, any answer. 
    "And so I'm supposed to do what? What are you saying I should do?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Kestor, I cannot tell you what you should do. But please, 
    please, do not waste your gifts. And do not lose sight of the fact that it 
    doesn't matter what your grandfather thought, or what his masters thought. It 
    doesn't matter if your ancestors were Krusual, Sebiestor, Thukker, even Ammatar… 
    it just doesn't matter, none of it! We are the Seven Tribes, but we are also the 
    Minmatar Nation. Seven and yet one. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"All that matters is what we think, now. What you and I think 
    together, here, in this room, and the others in this hospital ― what they think 
    matters too, maybe. And the other free thinkers in this city, on this planet, in 
    this star system. In all of Minmatar. The people who aren't stuck in the mud, 
    but who are looking up, and around. But mostly looking
    <i>inside</i>.</span></p>
  <p>
    <span>"What I am saying, Kestor, is just this: look inside. That is 
    where you will find the man who can give you the answers you need." </span>
  </p>

    <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>Where the Pieces Come Together</p></span></i>

  <p>
    <span>Just a few hundred meters out, the shuttle swung around a 
    landing bay on the surface of the massive, unmoving vessel. Only a tiny portion 
    of the behemoth was visible in the forward visor. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Well? As you can see, the construction is nearing 
    completion. I would say another thirteen, fourteen ― maybe sixteen months at the 
    outside, and she will be fully operational." The Chief Gravometrics Engineer for 
    Project Skymother was a precise man, but on a project of this magnitude, one had 
    to be willing to be somewhat flexible. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"She is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. My goodness."
    <span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span>The man's voice was still strong, not the 
    faded fluting of many others his age, but today there was a certain childish joy 
    in his tone that the Chief had not heard for some time. "I… it's only been a few 
    months since I saw her last, and already she is so much more…
    <i>together</i>. I guess? I suppose that's 
    the right word? </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"I've seen some remarkable things in my life. Shining Amarr 
    ships breaking up near the small moon of Bairshir IV, at the Battle of Halitt. 
    Pulse beams cutting through the dark near the Bosboger gate in Lulm. But all of 
    those moments are so tiny now, so distant. And this… this makes them all seem so 
    insignificant. My goodness." The old man's eyes were glistening. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The engineer watched the old man closely, giving him a moment 
    to control his emotions. To lose water from the eyes would have meant 
    embarrassment for them both. But when he spoke, he too was fighting back a lump 
    in his throat. "Yes, I suppose she is coming together. Internal crews are 
    already running tests on sublight systems. The jump drives have a little way to 
    go, but I would say, assuming the new tech from Six Kin meets your specs ― and 
    believe me, I don't doubt <i>you</i> for a 
    second ― well, let's say three months for that. Four, maybe. You'll have to come 
    back then, of course." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"Well, I certainly hope so, my old friend. I wouldn't want to 
    miss that. After all, I have spent a lifetime working toward this." </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>"I know it, Chieran. I know. How could I forget? Let's dock, 
    shall we, and see if we can't find something to eat? I have some virgin roe I 
    stashed away against your next visit. I trust you're still a fan?" </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Chief Gravometrics Engineer Kestor Thevistos reached forward 
    to tap the controls of the shuttle. Chieran reached forward to get one last look 
    at the surface of the great ship beside them before they swung about to dock, 
    and as he did so, he caught his weight with a hand on Kestor's shoulder. His 
    flesh was so frail now, so pale and spotted. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Kestor smiled, the lump still in his throat, and brought the 
    shuttle around. </span>
