# "A Life in Three Acts"

<p>
 
</p>
<p>The body rests. The thalamus, deep core and center of 
all things, resonates with itself at a rate so slow it's barely a murmur. All 
limbs are still and metabolism is kept to a minimum, with nothing floating 
through the bloodstream but a few hormones placidly drifting towards breakdown. 
The heart beats, the lungs inflate and deflate, and everything ticks over as it 
always has. In a dozen places the skin quivers slightly from nearly 
imperceptible electrical currents passed through it by the attached monitors.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A foreign substance hovers into the lungs, squeezing 
past the bronchioles alongside the oxygen and insinuating itself through the 
capillaries into the bloodstream. Moments later the central nervous system is 
dampened, and while there's possibly a flicker of activity in the thalamus, the 
state of rest remains unaltered.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The skin is broken for the first time. Several 
punctures are created right above the crook of each elbow, and in the skin a 
finger's breath below the heart. Needles slide in with mechanical accuracy, 
pierce veins, and begin to pump in chemicals. Several smaller punctures are made 
along the base of the spine, and a line of very narrow, very long needles slide 
in at a glacial pace, penetrating the subdural region. These needles pump in a 
single dose of something that immediately dulls the entire autonomic nervous 
system, leaving the brain unaware of the changes occurring to it and disinclined 
to start making a fuss.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The body begins to change. Since the chemicals are 
initially pumped away from the heart, the first parts affected are the limbs and 
the less complex internal organs; and, of course, the blood. Regular blood cells 
begin to die off, their walls eaten up by the intrusive substance while new, 
more robust ones are pumped out of bone marrow by the millions. These new cells, 
whose oxygen-carrying capability far exceeds that of the old and dying ones, 
grow to maturity in a matter of instants. The lungs then kick in, their alveoli 
adapting to letting in more oxygen than this body has ever been able to 
assimilate. The muscles swiftly respond, followed by various other organs, 
gorging themselves on this new red breath.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Once the chemical reaches the brain, change begins in 
earnest. Sinews strengthen and lengthen without overstretching. Bones are eaten 
away, their porous, paper-like remains left covered in a sticky residue that 
seeps into the remaining calcified matter, links and reacts, and eventually 
hardens into matrix-like structures far stronger than the original material. The 
heart is less altered, its ventricles merely expanding to deal with the onrush 
of new blood to a stronger body. It suffers some palpitations, but these even 
out quickly and the needles do not stop pumping in the chemicals.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The body is being put through extreme rigors. Muscles 
are tensed and flexed consistently, alternating between upper and lower sections 
of the skeleton, and reknotting themselves into stronger versions at a pace far 
beyond any past results. While the heart's rate of growth has remained less than 
might be expected, lung capacity has increased by leaps and bounds. All other 
organs remain in line, having picked up the pace much as a child who'd learned 
to walk and is now reveling in the joy of an endless run.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With this growth come new natural limits that also get 
tested with a vigor bordering on self-destruction. There is sleep deprivation, 
and the thalamus that once served its purpose with hushed consistency now 
regularly gets yanked in and out of REM without mercy, its waves spiking in dull 
panic. The skin routinely gets shocked with extremes of hot and cold, but the 
brain is learning to compensate for these differences, blood vessels 
constricting and expanding with high rapidity. Despite their increased size the 
new blood cells are more pliable than the older version and manage to get around 
beneath the outermost layer even when it has restricted and blocked off all 
outside interference. This is a powerful and resilient system now: locked down, 
coiled, and waiting.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There is a moment when the body relaxes, going as deep 
into theta as it consciously can. Some adrenaline still courses through the 
bloodstream, and various systems are on semi-prepared standby, but the brain 
orders all to stand down, fall back, and hold position. There is a wait.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A mild electric current passes through the body, its 
contact point located at the ankles. It causes the leg muscles to tense, jerk 
and finally convulse, pulling against each other. Every muscle is slowly worked 
over: The current brings it to its maximum twitching power, its glycogen stores 
are exhausted and its lactic acid is pumped back into the bloodstream. The lungs 
work overtime to the point where the visual cortex starts having issues decoding 
information and the labyrinth in the inner ear fails to maintain a proper sense 
of balance. Sensing this, the brain - still keeping the thalamus calm and 
producing delta waves - orders the diaphragm's contractions to ease up. It does 
so, reluctantly, and general equilibrium is slowly reestablished. The electric 
current moves up past the calves and the thighs, then separates, one contact 
sliding up the ventral nervous system and another one going up the lateral. They 
alternate their efforts over various muscles on either side, and things start to 
go wrong.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One back muscle, rarely trained, overstretches. In 
response the body's torso, which has been trained to much higher levels, cramps 
up and heaves. The effort combines with the current and begins to tear the back 
muscle apart, its striated cords snapping like the wires of a bridge in a 
tornado. The adrenal glands go nuts, pumping out adrenaline and other 
corticosteroids at the highest rate they can. The thalamus, by now used to being 
pounded into activity, jerks awareness back into action. All conscious control 
of the lungs is lost and air is expelled at high rates, the vocal cords 
vibrating so hard that their mucus lining begins to dry. Blood gets pumped into 
all extremities at twice the normal rate, which only accelerates the body's 
thrashings and the destruction of the back muscle. The heart, in fact, has an 
agonizing time keeping up, but its skipped beats are masked from detection by 
the flood of adrenaline.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The skin gets broken, a vein is pierced and sedatives 
begin to flood in. The pain stays constant but the system begins to relax 
involuntarily; cramping slows and finally ceases, brainwaves even out, and the 
battered adrenal glands return to normal. For a while there is utter stillness. 
Then a spot on the back, on the skin over the torn muscle, gets covered with 
something that begins to intrudes. The skin is not broken but permeated, as if 
water were passing through a wet cloth, and it grows very warm. The muscle also 
warms up even as the blood drains from it. Its tendrils reach out and hungrily 
eat a glut of nutrients carried to them by the surrounding cells. They start to 
intertwine, growing stronger and more pliable, morphing into cords of much 
greater tenacity. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The skin is uncovered. Very mild electrical pulses are 
applied to the torso, and the body slowly bends, stretching the back muscle. It 
stays unbroken, and the dulled brain, awake but unmoving, registers no signs of 
danger.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Eardrums, until now blessedly free of irritants, 
receive sounds that quickly dull the alpha waves and bring consciousness back in 
with speed. The brain becomes fully conscious of its state again, and the body's 
muscles gently flex and tense. The adrenal glands squirt a little in nervous 
anticipation, but nothing gets torn. The body is ready.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Later on it will receive a shock in motion that 
impacts hard enough to test even the matrices of the bones, but they withstand 
it. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Eventually the body experiences a lift, and a drop, 
and olfactory senses report that the air smells very different.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Rest comes harder than before and delta waves are 
barely even present; the body jerks itself into consciousness at the least 
little irritant, whether on eardrums, nose, or skin. The adrenal glands, in good 
practice, happily help out each time with generous supplies of corticosteroids, 
but eventually the brain reins them in.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The temperature shocks prove to have been helpful as 
the skin is now exposed to higher fluctuations over greater lengths of time than 
before. The heat doesn't cause damage but does interfere with gastric control, 
and there are several occasions where the adrenaline, the heat and high activity 
in the prefrontal cortex cause the stomach to vacate. Eventually the composition 
of ingested contents alters, lowering slightly in fat and starch and increasing 
in complex carbohydrates, fiber and various phytochemicals. There is also less 
alcohol ingestion, and eventually the stomach settles down and remains stable.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over time the body settles into a groove. Everything 
goes at its pace, all glands function, and if there is the rarest of half-missed 
beats from the heart, the rest of the system more than makes up for it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So when, at last, the eardrums are assaulted and the 
thalamus shocked out of deep delta waves, and the body is fairly thrown to hands 
and knees, the shock isn't quite enough to cause any immediate lockup. The 
eardrums keep taking in and filtering everything they can, while both visual 
cortex and motor control narrow their focus, accomplishing in linear order 
several tasks that are so practiced they have long since been ingrained in the 
subconscious. The body rises and begins to run, the hands slightly tensed to 
hold their deadly baggage, the skin on the fingers cooling from steely contact. 
Now the visual cortex takes over, the head craning back and forth while the legs 
piston and the lungs work, and every now and then the body will stop, crouch, 
process visuals and react through hand movements, either a wave or a slight pull 
of a finger.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It is during the exit from one such crouch that the 
eardrums process a loud whine, and immediately after the skin is massively 
broken, not merely torn but shredded off, veins pieced and muscles taken off in 
chunks. The abdominals contract with all the power they can muster, and air is 
forced out of the lungs, the vocal cords vibrating at high frequencies. All 
systems go independent; legs give out, hands cramp up and eardrums vibrate with 
a merciless rat-tat-tat; bladder goes into overdrive and so does adrenal gland, 
pumping like there's no tomorrow. Adrenaline courses through the system at 
unprecedented rates, while the blood cells, engorged with oxygen, deliver it to 
whatever extremities they can before flowing through the broken skin and out 
into the unknown; and in all these imbalances and all this stress the heart, 
having ticked away in duty and stress forever until this very moment, at last 
loses its grip: cramps up, goes on strike, stops. The body convulses, eyes 
rolling around in their sockets, and in those last shooting moments of pain and 
confusion there is just enough time for the brain to realize it has been cut off 
from the flow, and for the eardrums to process one last noise fast approaching, 
before the body is crushed, cut and burned by a force far greater than it has 
ever experienced, and even the matrices of its bones give out at last, their 
cracks the final sounds before the quiet, definite and final onfall of death.</p>
