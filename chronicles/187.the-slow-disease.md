# The Slow Disease

<p>
        Tibus Heth, Executor of the Caldari Providence Directorate and de facto leader of
        the Caldari State, sat alone in the waiting room of Dr. Yoshun's Corporate &amp;
        Family Practices. He fanned himself with a plain brown filing folder that bore neither
        label nor seal. The breeze it created was slight, though it was a gust compared
        to the pitiable whimper of the room's climate control unit.</p>
    <p>
        He shifted his weight to his right side as he pulled out an old metallic watch.
        The case was smooth and cool to the touch, its contours blemished by minor scratches
        and the occasional dent. The back still bore a fading decal that read, "Employee
        of the Month." He stared at the ticking hands, blinked himself out of a tired
        trance, and returned the watch to his pocket, a cycle he had completed twelve times
        during his wait. Despite his history with Caldari Constructions, he was fond of
        his non-monetary reward. It was a good, mechanical watch. Tibus always preferred
        things he could fix himself.
    </p>
    <p>
        After stretching in his chair with a grunt (answered by a small series of hollow
        pops from his back), Tibus opened the manila folder. Inside was a series of monochrome
        reports printed on cheap white paper. The calm, pristine lines of standard Caldari
        report formatting were completely negated by Tibus's numerous inline notations
        and marginal scribblings. Lines crossed between sections; questions scribbled in
        the margins were answered by other, more frantic questions. Everything suggested
        connections, but none were made.</p>
        <p>
            The first report profiled former Gallente president, Souro Foiritan. Foiritan was
            the perfect model of a Gallente politician, averse to direct , especially military,
            action but skilled enough with words to thwart the efforts of his enemies. His recent
            resignation had taken the intelligence community by surprise. Only its timing suggested
            any sort of connection, especially with the purchase of his homeworld, Intaki, by
            the Ishukone.</p>
        <p>
            A second report picked up that story. It listed the movements of Ishukone ships,
            personnel, and other assets over the past year. The megacorporation, and its CEO,
            Mens Reppola, were Tibus's greatest internal political enemies. When the Caldari
            militia held complete dominance of Black Rise and development rights were auctioned
            off, Ishukone had bid only on Intaki. More curiously, they had contracted the mercenary
            company Mordu's Legion to police the system. Conspiracy theories were stranger
            still, but no evidence could be brought to bear.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final report in the folder, marred by a web of Tibus's notes, detailed the
            new Gallente president, Jacus Roden. The majority of the report was long outdated.
            Intelligence was playing catch-up. Roden's life was well documented until his
            retirement from his position as CEO of Roden Shipyards. The trail went completely
            cold there, picking up again only with Roden's recent meteoric rise back into
            the public spotlight and the presidency.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tibus pinched the bridge of his nose. He read the reports more than a dozen times,
            each time realizing more connections. He had long suspected that Foiritan and Reppola
            conspired against him, but Foiritan's fall and Roden's ascent did not fit.
            All three men were intelligent and immensely capable; nothing they did was accidental.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only way it made any sense to Tibus was through an intricate conspiracy supported
            by a network of Gallente agents operating within the State: The Federation use Intaki
            as a way to funnel their spies into the State; Foiritan resigns as a distraction;
            and Roden assumes control of the Gallente government, plausibly clean of the Intaki
            affair and the most powerful man in the Federation.</p>
        <p>
            Tibus knew it sounded insane, but he also knew such machinations were possible.
            The Broker proved that idea.</p>
        <p>
            Flushing those agents out would be a painful task. Tibus's political power was
            not absolute. If he targeted Ishukone and questioned their loyalty without any hard
            evidence, the other megacorps would turn on him. He could authorize a State-wide
            inquiry to save face, but that would consume time and energy that could be spent
            elsewhere. How much could he risk on suspicions alone?</p>
        <p>
            A knock at the door startled Tibus out of his headspace. He scrambled to replace
            the documents back in the folder. A nurse peeked her head in from the adjoining
            hallway. "Sir? Mister, ah…" she trailed off, taking another puzzled glance
            at the appointment list she carried. "Mister Adar?"</p>
        <p>
            "That's me." He smiled.</p>
        <p>
            "Sorry. Thought you looked like Tibus Heth for a second. Dr. Yoshun is ready
            to see you."</p>
<p align="center">
             ***</p>
        <p>
            Tibus sat on the small table in the examination room. The room was spartan and slightly
            too cold to be comfortable (a practice Tibus had found uniformly maddening in all
            doctors' offices). A canned smell halfway between fresh flowers and mouthwash permeated
            the air. The only decoration was a small poster of a human heart attached to a time
            bomb, with the accusing phrase, "PREVENTION SAVES LIVES," in bold beneath
            it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standing above Tibus was Dr. Yoshun. He was a younger man with dark hair, and his
            long, white coat bore the Caldari Constructions logo on either sleeve. It had only
            been five years since Yoshun took over as the CC physician for the district, but
            the pressures of maintaining the practice on his corporate budget had already aged
            him well beyond that time span. Tibus noted that, regardless of Yoshun's degree
            of experience, he had perfected a disapproving scowl.</p>
        <p>
            "Tibus, I'm flattered that you want to stick with your old planetary physician
            and all, but you haven't had a proper checkup since, you know, <i>everything</i>.
            And insisting that your appointment not push out any of the other patients is borderline
            treason. You're the most powerful man in the State."</p>
        <p>
            The older man took the berating in stride. Their personal dynamic was established
            during Tibus's years with the company. Yoshun was one of the few loyal company men
            Tibus always trusted. "I'm a citizen of the State first," he replied.
            "I don't deserve preferential treatment."</p>
        <p>
            "Don't give me that crap. Your health is not a damn political statement. These
            tests should have been run a long time ago." Yoshun raised an admonishing finger.
            "And before you say it, I don't care how busy you've been. Getting the blood
            results back took two days. Two days! If you had just one blood test and two days
            available a year ago, everything could have been different."</p>
        <p>
            Tibus adopted a skeptical face. "You're being melodramatic, Yoshun. I've
            been exercising regularly. I'm sure as hell eating better than I ever did in
            the company cafeteria. The pain in my leg comes and goes, but other than that I
            feel—"</p>
        <p>
            "You have Derj's disease."</p>
        <p>
            The room fell silent. The climate control droned on. Half a minute passed before
            Tibus showed any further reaction. "Derj's disease?"</p>
        <p>
            "It's also known as exotic tissue sedimentation, or 'miner's disease.'"</p>
        <p>
            "I goddamn know what it is!" Tibus blurted. He clenched and released his fists several
            times, trying to control himself. When his composure returned, he asked, "How far
            is it?"</p>
        <p>
            Yoshun pulled out his battered datapad, fighting briefly with the slow machine.
            "It's stage three. Deposits have started to form around neural tissues. Needless
            to say, your blood's full of the stuff. If we had detected it earlier, we might
            have scrubbed you of it in a month. As it is, we can treat most of your symptoms,
            but you'll never really be cured."</p>
        <p>
            "Is it...." Tibus trailed off, struggling with his mouth to form the word.</p>
        <p>
            "No. At least, not technically. Look, with the kind of resources you have at your
            disposal, there's no reason you couldn't live a full, natural lifespan.
            This never has to reach stage four. But — and this is a large 'but' — the
            deposits that have already developed interfere with brain mapping. They corrupt
            the results in unpredictable ways."</p>
        <p>
            "I can never clone?"</p>
        <p>
            "If you were to ever attempt to clone, there's a strong probability of permanent
            and irreversible neural damage. The worst-case scenario, and not an unlikely one,
            is that your new body would just never wake up."</p>
        <p>
            More seconds passed as Tibus processed his new fate. He felt the watch's subtle
            ticking in his pocket. "How?"</p>
        <p>
            "Augumen exposure. You most likely came into contact while moving construction materials
            for the company.</p>
        <p>
            "Augumen is illegal for construction use. Hell, it was illegal before I took
            over."</p>
        <p>
            "Yeah, it was illegal. But augumen is also a hell of a lot cheaper than pyroxeres,
            and it's damned easy for inspectors to miss the difference."</p>
        <p>
            Tibus's gaze hardened. He knew the answer to his next question, but asked anyway.
            "You're certain the company did this?"</p>
        <p>
            "I don't have any proof," Yoshun set his datapad aside, "but yes."</p>
        <p align="center">
             ***</p>
        <p>
            Executor Heth's security entourage immediately greeted him as he exited the
            small practice. They were all wearing the latest in personal armor, shiny and clean
            in the evening sun, contrasting heavily with the weather-worn building. If his men
            tired of waiting outside, they made no mention of it. Jinyo, a tiny man in an over-starched
            suit, Heth's acting aid and ever the functionary, hurried to the executor's
            side. He was madly tapping on his top-of-the-line KK datapad, juggling dozens of
            meetings and mails.</p>
        <p>
            "I hope everything went well, sir. I know you prefer to keep things humble, but
            we really should find you better and closer health care. In the past seven hours,
            eighteen new issues arose that require your attention."</p>
        <p>
            "Yes," he replied, "I'm sure." Heth began walking briskly to the parked, nondescript
            Speeder they had arrived in. His entourage hurried behind. Their leader was walking
            a brisker pace than they were used to keeping.</p>
        <p>
            All of Heth's old and new angers and frustrations mixed together, merged, and fueled
            a resolve he had forgotten since the first day of his tiny workers' revolt.
            Even his limp felt lessened. "Jinyo, I have new orders."</p>
        <p>
            "Yes, sir?" The tiny man made a dozen taps on his datapad.</p>
        <p>
            "First, launch an investigation into Caldari Constructions' use of augumen in building
            materials, going back ten years. No excuses, just names or heads. Second, I want
            a full-time, dedicated personal physician. Schedule regular checkups, tests, the
            whole gamut." Heth put his hand in his pocket and felt the watch's cold, dented
            case.</p>
        <p>
            "Third, Jinyo, the Caldari people need to know their government is healthy. I want
            a list of our most loyal, incorruptible officials and investigators, Navy background
            preferred. Weakness and timidity have allowed an infection to grow within the State.
            We will burn it out."</p>
