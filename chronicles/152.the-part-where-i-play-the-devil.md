# The Part Where I Play the Devil

![The Part Where I Play the Devil](images/playthedevil.jpg)

 
<p>
</p>
<p>Let me tell you about the mad man and the wonders he 
performs.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My name is Alder Brenean. I am one of the aides to His 
Royal Highness, an Heir to the throne of the Amarr Empire, beloved charge and 
leader of his fiefdom, Aritcio Kor-Azor.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have not been doing this job for long and already it 
is a marvel beyond anything I had imagined. I do not sleep much. I eat at 
irregular hours. I hold conversations - brief, fleeting words, and of a servile 
nature, but still spoken out loud and answered - with men who operate at the 
highest level of government, and with men who operate only in the shadows.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My lord has not always been loved. There was a time 
where he was considered merely a shrewd politician, fitter to rise than to rule. 
There was also a time where he had ruled so terribly, and done such awful 
things, that the people rose against him. A religious man intervened, a Speaker 
of Truths, and he saved my lord, but for such a price that I cannot speak of.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When he returned to his duties he was a new man. He 
was also a kind man, one who thought very hard about the lives of his subjects 
and how to better them. He has been on that mission ever since: To improve the 
lives of the people who serve him and whom, he strongly emphasizes, he serves in 
turn.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Part of that rejuvenation was to bring on a new group 
of people, ones who could help him rule his heirdom in the most humane, 
efficient way possible. I am one of his new recruits. I took my exams, and 
without divulging how I did on them, I can attest that I did not fail in my 
duties.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When I was interviewed the lord asked me whether I was 
faithful. I said I was. He asked me whether I was faithful to the people, the 
ruler, or my lord God. I said that as far as I was concerned, these three were 
indistinguishable. He smiled, for the first time in our interview. A day later I 
was brought on.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One of the ongoing missions begun by my lord is to 
travel around his kingdom, both to familiarize himself with his people - and 
them with him - and to ensure their lives meet the standards he has set for a 
Kor-Azor person. This applies equally to Holder and Commoner. It even extends to 
slaves, whom my lord believes are no less worthy, in their way, than the people 
they serve. In this he is assisted by a cadre of able people among whom I 
proudly count myself. I am trusted with secrets, and I believe my lord sees 
something in me that I may not see myself, for he routinely has me on hand in 
meetings of a most delicate nature. He does not ask my opinion, but he does 
enquire of my analysis on certain court matters. I suspect he may find my 
perspective of some use, unfettered as it is by actual experience with political 
intrigue.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our agents had determined that the subjects on a 
particular planet in my lord's kingdom were ... not fomenting rebellion or 
anything of that sort, but certainly murmuring in increasing unrest. This had 
not, our agents stressed, been reported nor acknowledged in any official 
capacity, and thus my lord would have to be careful of political repercussions 
if he were to present himself as a peacemaker.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The main problem with this planet, they explained - 
and one of the factors in the unrest of its people - was the political 
machinations inherent in its rule. The people were governed by several lords - 
Holders all, of course - each of whom in turn owed their allegiance to a 
continental overseer. Those overlords served under a planetary representative, 
who in turn filed regular reports directly to my lord and master. We noted that 
in his recent reports there had been no mention of any trouble.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This setup of governance was not the typical one in 
our Empire, and had been put in place long before my lord's ascension to 
heirdom. Not only was it tied down with strings that would prove costly to cut, 
but the planet's economy was so enmeshed in labyrinthine pacts by the ruling 
body that were my lord to intervene in a lawful and justifiable way, it would be 
a long time before we could even hope to wrest control of the planet over to us. 
This struck me as a strange state of affairs, but my lord explained that it was 
in fact a common one, and that the Heirs, even with their ecclesial authority, 
did not have as much secular power as they liked to pretend. He added that 
despite this state of affairs and our agents' reports of planetary issues, we 
should not necessarily assume that there would be trouble. Many of the most 
highly complex, politically sensitive problems of our age could be solved with a 
simple, elegant solution that more often than not did not tackle the problem 
head-on, but instead caused it to cease to exist. All one needed to do was find 
the right angle, and to act decisively, with the solution clear in one's mind. 
Never waver, he said, once you know what you need to do, and never lose heart.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We arrived in terrible weather. The space elevators, 
secure thought they might be, made me nauseous. It wasn't merely the travel - 
though the occasional sense of sideways pressure never failed to remind me that 
we were swaying in midair halfway between the earth and the stars - but the idea 
of traveling back from the skies and down to solid ground. There are people, and 
I know many of them, who prefer to stay on solid ground all their lives, making 
it the bedrock of their faith. I cannot do this. To me, ascension is literal; I 
feel that to be closer to God, Man needs to rise to meet Him. For some this 
might be a metaphysical ascension, for others a physical one. But to descend 
again, into a strange place where I would meet people who lived their entire 
lives <i>out of preference</i> under what they saw as a closed-off, threatening, 
solid metal sky - that descent would truly put me among strangers to my faith.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My lord arrived to great fanfare, none of it of his 
own making. Speeches were expected and given, and we took a few days merely to 
travel between areas, visiting different locales and gauging the crowds' 
reactions to my lord's presence as much as his words. It became clear, through 
the murmurs and our hushed listening, that they did not want him here. They were 
receptive to his presence, which sounds contradictory to their standoffish 
reception but was not a surprise. To them he did not represent hope - and it was 
clear these people needed more hope - but merely another leadership figure in a 
long line that grew ever more threatening and unpopular the higher up they 
looked at it; and the fact that he was speaking to them with a message of 
positivity merely made him a novelty. Or, in some of the more hostile areas, a 
politician and a liar.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless we sensed an openness, a subdued 
willingness to hear what he had to say. The people turned up in droves, and as 
much as they might not believe in my lord's words or what he stood for, they 
listened attentively to what he said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I must add that the continental overseers did not 
quite follow suit. For every word of praise or support my lord spoke to the 
masses, the leaders, in turn, spoke a subtly negative one of stilted progress; 
or, even worse, they spoke not at all. Before too long it had become clear that 
they were very happy with this situation and had no intention of allowing my 
lord - the presumption these people had! - of allowing my lord to intervene, no 
matter how unstable and unpleasant the life on this planet had become for the 
poor commoners.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Thus the first few days and nights passed. I prayed in 
the evenings while my lord met with his private councilors. Many of them arrived 
at his quarters, spoke briefly, then left for parts unknown.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Eventually he knocked on my door and informed me that 
the next part of our journey here would commence. The time for speeches was over 
and the time for inspection had begun. If I had not known my lord's ways as well 
as I do, I would have thought of him in much the same terms as the poor, 
earth-bound people on this planet: As a politician, who, having spread his 
prattle, now intended to make a few symbolic appearances in mock fellowship with 
the locals. It was a rote item of schedule for many politicians in all parts of 
the world.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My lord, however, had his own reasons for ambling down 
this well-trodden path. The public appearances required neither his presence of 
mind nor his oratory faculties. He could attend, no matter how tired and worn, 
and have the brunt of the effort undertaken by those he was visiting. And at 
night, when no one saw, he could undertake the true purpose of this part of our 
mission.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The true measure of a people is not the attitude they 
have towards their leaders or visiting dignitaries, no more than you can judge 
children by how they speak to their parents or guests of the house. Those whose 
minds represent the truth of their selves will have the sense to keep up their 
masks at all times, or at least maintain proper decorum, and those who cannot 
even do that are usually too crazy to be useful as barometers of temper and 
mood. If you want to see how children truly feel, don't look at the way they 
behave towards their parents; spy on them and find out how they treat their 
siblings. You may have to wait until there is a crisis, something that puts 
pressure on the children to interact with each other, but then you'll surely see 
it: Who pushes their brothers into a corner, and who embraces them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our people went out into the night to find out these 
things, and my lord did the same.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I can not think of any politician or ruler who does 
this. Even if they tried, I cannot imagine any who could do it to their 
advantage. It takes an extraordinary degree of precision, finesse, insight and 
ability to react to go out there into the open and be amongst people as if they 
were your own.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They would come in during the mornings, tired and 
worn, and confer with each other on the night's progress. My lord wore his 
protective gear, of course; morph fields that blocked him from sight and 
identification, and permeation-proof lightweight armor that would protect him 
from direct assault. He remained partially vulnerable to natural disasters - 
floods, fires and building collapses - but he took care with those, he said, and 
did not put himself at undue risk. My lord routinely did this on the trips he 
went on, and while I will admit that at first it gave me grave suspicions - I 
have never quite trusted those stories of high-borns going out in disguise among 
the public, suspecting as I do that their disguises were highly transparent and 
that their social explorations were carefully steered by their retinue - I soon 
noted that he had a skill for it, and a Commoner's instincts for survival, that 
served him well. He had never been found out.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I had always had my suspicions about my lord's nightly 
endeavors, and that they might be about more than merely sizing up the 
temperament of the local populace, but I was shocked when I saw him stumble in 
one morning, leaning against walls and clearly having a difficult time with 
movement. When I asked him whether I could be of assistance, he let out a little 
laugh and asked me to help him out of his armor. I did, and gasped when I saw 
his back.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Something had fallen on him, hard enough to rupture 
the armor's defenses, and it would likely have left bruises had there been any 
unblemished skin to affect. My lord's back was burnt and scarred, as if he had 
walked through the hellfires themselves. I asked whether he needed the services 
of a doctor, at which he let out a wheezing laugh and declined my offer. He had, 
he said, suffered the services of the doctors in the past. These days he 
preferred to let his own body rebuild itself</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>His hands and feet were sore, too, reddened and worn, 
but the gloves and boots he'd worn had luckily taken most of the brunt. They 
were gone, he said, their tatters left somewhere on the streets of this strange 
earth.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He did not explain the burns, but merely said they had 
taught him all he needed to know about inhabitants on this planet. They were not 
a distant or rebellious people, he added, but they needed a proper rallying cry, 
along with someone they could trust to shout it from above. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I <i>did</i> check the next morning's news and 
discovered there had been a massive fire the night before. Volunteers had 
arrived from all over in an attempt to extinguish it and save innocent people 
from harm. Pursuant to this I combed through any available articles for a 
mention of mysterious strangers, or a vision of some blurred corner in a picture 
of the fire, but found none.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Some might have felt he was wasting his time - not in 
saving people, which is never a waste, but in spending his time among them like 
this. But he has told me often that the big picture is made out of many small 
details. You must be among your own people, he says. You must. If you lose that 
connection, you stand to lose so much more.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He had his dreams that night; the ones where he 
screams. But in the morning he was very calm.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The penultimate part of our journey was a meeting with 
its planetary leader. As I explained, the economic and political situations on 
this planet were very much intertwined. Old independence agreements, most of a 
financial bent, had held off any direct changes brought from the outside, while 
the extremely complex interplay between various internal forces on the planet 
meant there was no way for my lord or anyone else even to squeeze in among the 
cracks as a private investor and start working any change in that manner. The 
intermediary continental leaders had given us no support. Unless we received 
backing from the planetary representative, we were going to have a hard time 
enacting any change in this place, no matter how positive.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The representative had invited us to his office, at 
the penthouse on one of the tallest buildings on the planet, but my lord 
politely declined the offer. Instead he asked that the meeting be held in his 
own quarters, which had been furnished with his personal belongings and were 
spacious enough to hold a platoon of soldiers. The representative was quick to 
accept this counteroffer, sending us a brief acknowledgment to that effect. I 
suggested to my lord that the man was eager to see us gone from here, and he 
nodded, adding that before this happened, changes would have to be enacted. He 
asked that I remain in the meeting as a secretary of events and a 
representative. When I enquired whether it would not behoove my lord to present 
a show of strength - a small cadre of stronger men to better face off the team 
our representative was likely to bring - he gave me a brief and not very 
humorous smile, and said that if his suspicions about the man and his persons 
were correct, he would not be bringing anyone at all.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I could scarcely imagine anyone insulting my lord like 
that, but I agreed to his wishes.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shortly before the visit I went through the room to 
ensure nothing was out of place. I aligned my lord's copies of the Pax Amarria, 
and his selections of ancient scriptures. The banners were hung in the 
appropriate order, while the ceremonial weapons were kept, at my lord's request, 
well at the back. Subtly hidden among them was the Khumaak, a weapon not many 
Amarrians would dare keep in their possession. I had always had my own 
sentiments about my lord's reasons for keeping a copy of this bloodied relic 
among the more proper holy ones of our own people, but what happened later that 
evening cast its presence in a new and disconcerting light.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The administrator came in and was immediately hostile 
to my lord's suggestions. He said, in response to my lord's worries on the 
increased instability in various regions, that he did not intend to let anything 
disturb his rule of this planet. Leaving aside the dictatorial attitude 
reflected in that comment, it was a vicious and grossly inappropriate jab at my 
lord's attempts to improve the life of his constituents. I had seen some of the 
intermediate members of the heirdom act like this after my lord returned to his 
duties, though thankfully they were growing ever rarer.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My lord asked if the governor simply intended to quell 
any opposition from the commoners, and the governor said that he would. When my 
lord added that the Caldari governing board had thought the same, and that it 
had not turned out so well for them, the governor grew visibly flustered. He 
cast me a look - I had sat in a corner of the office and barely been noticed by 
the man - that seemed to imply I was responsible for my lord's approach, as if I 
were one of the poor Commoners he ruled and clearly disdained.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The governor told my lord that, in all honesty, life 
on this planet was going to continue unaltered, and that while my lord's 
benevolent probings - he actually used those words - were certainly laudable and 
guaranteed to carry favor with our newly elected Empress, they were far removed 
from the political reality of the world this governor ruled. There would be no 
change while he was in office, and given his political ties with others on this 
planet, there would be no way that my lord could attempt to oust him, no matter 
how many of those filthy little people - that language again - he brought to 
bear.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I was speechless by the man's audacity. My lord, on 
the other hand, calmly got up, walked over to the governor and, smiling wide, 
extended his hand. It took the governor a few moments before he extended his own 
and smiled back. My lord said that the situation was clear and that he truly did 
appreciate the situation: That as long as the governor was in power, no matter 
what instability reigned, things would go on as before. He understood this, he 
said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The governor made as if to speak, but my lord 
continued, saying that how unfortunate it was to have any unrest, tend as it did 
to spiral completely out of control. He added that despite this, and despite the 
fact that this unrest, once it <i>did</i> spiral out of control, would 
inevitably end up at the shores of his own royal offices, he did understand the 
governor's way of thinking. After all, he said at last, he had once held much 
the same viewpoint.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The governor fairly yanked his hand out of my lord's 
grasp, but maintained his smile.</p>
<p>
</p>
My lord turned to me and politely asked me to leave.

<p>
</p>
<p>I was surprised by this, but said nothing and got up 
from my chair. I walked quietly by the walls and towards the exit. My lord 
followed and met me at the doors, opening them for me. I gave him a quizzical 
look</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"This is the part where I play the Devil," he said, 
with such a mixture of regret and relief as I have never heard from a man.</p>
<p>
</p>
He saw me through and closed the doors after me.

<p>
</p>
<p>Not knowing what else to do, I stood outside the room, 
waiting for the meeting to be over. I did not spy or eavesdrop; I could not have 
even if I had tried, for the walls and the doors were made of thick material. 
After a brief while, though, I heard raised voices, mostly from the governor. 
The voices rose until one of them became a shout. It was punctured by several 
muffled thuds, rising to a near-shriek, before falling quiet altogether.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The door opened a crack, and when I saw my lord's face 
peer through, I let out a long exhale that I had not even realized I'd been 
holding in. His hair glistened with sweat, though he seemed to have thoroughly 
wiped it off his face; and his eyes were wide open. He asked me to call up 
certain members of his retinue, for he had something they needed to take care 
of.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This I did. I did not mention to them or anyone else 
that I had seen the Khumaak lying on the ground behind my lord.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The day after, I saw a glut of news reports, all of 
them detailing the governor's disappearance. It seemed that his p.v. had 
malfunctioned while in mid-flight and crashed into the ocean, hours before his 
scheduled meeting with my lord. The news included a quote from Heir Aritcio 
Kor-Azor where he exclaimed not only his profound sadness over the loss of this 
great man, but his disappointment that their meeting on the political and 
economical future of the planet had not taken place. The papers went on to quote 
my lord in that he hoped he could still hold meetings with the various overseers 
of individual continental entities, and that these meetings could conclude with 
a better outcome than this terrible, terrible occurrence.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When my lord embarked on the last series of journeys 
over this strange earth, his speeches received a much better reaction from the 
workforce. This might have been helped by recent concessions announced by the 
continental leaders, who had decided to embark on massive audits of commoner 
health, safety and economic troubles. Unfortunately, this sudden development 
meant they were all too busy to meet with my lord, but he took it with his usual 
good humor, and we started preparing for our departure.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As we were travelling back up to the waiting ship, in 
that hellish elevator, my lord turned to me and said that the lives of everyone 
on this planet would be improved. He asked if I was happy with this.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I understood the question that he had asked, and the 
one he had not. I said that yes, I was.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He smiled and said that was good; for he wanted 
everyone to be happy.</p>
<p>
</p>
I believed him.

<p>
</p>
We rose to the skies.
