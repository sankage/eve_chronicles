Bethora looked out the station window,  waiting for the race to begin. The windows here in the royal quarters were quite  expansive, far more so than in most other sections of the station, and gave a  good view of both the planet below and of the stars in the distance. The glass  in the windows was warm, too, which was rare on space stations. Microscopic  filaments embedded in the glass generated a constant supply of heat, and the  material in the windows was specially mixed to conduct it well. The heat loss  through this process was horrendous, and so it was only offered to the richest  of clients.

The comfort wasn't solely for the benefit  of visiting royalty. As part of the Ardishapur family, Bethora frequently had  to play host to a number of tradesmen, merchants and religious officials, most  of whom regularly visited the space station but wouldn't go to the planet's  surface. Travels between planet and station were expensive if you wanted any  degree of comfort, and while the royal court could get the most comfortable  seats free of charge, anyone else would either have to pay, or accept being  stowed away like so much cargo and livestock.

So Bethora went up to the sky on a regular  basis. She enjoyed it. Things were simpler here, she found, and offered opportunity  for reflection and quiet. This time around, the retinue even included her son,  who was about to compete in the space races.

She turned from the window and looked to  the royal banners hanging from the walls, decorated with the Amarrian crest and  the various sigils of her family. The banners swayed a little, gently wafted by  air conditioners discreetly planted in the walls behind them. Beneath the banners  stood the royal furniture, old and splendid: chairs of thick, dark oak, covered  in embroidered pillows; various old paper books on shelves, chronicling the family  history; gold and silver cutlery and dishware.

The last was being polished by Javies, Bethora's  manservant, who mumbled genteel obscenities about the state of the place and  the competence of the staff. Javies was part of Bethora's retinue, and went  with her on all official trips. They routinely visited the space station, and  every time, he expressed his astonishment at the lackadaisical attitude the  staff onboard seemed to have towards basic cleanliness. The silverware, he maintained,  looked like it had been stored in a coalmine, and the less said about the dust  on the tables, the better.

Bethora, who was in most other respects a  strict and proper person, didn't begrudge Javies his little complaints. The man  had been in service to her family for a long time, and had assisted willingly in  various tasks that younger men would have begged leave from. He knew when it  was all right to talk, and when one should remain silent.

Bethora looked back out the window, staring  at the planet. She heard Javies's footsteps approach.

"Brings us closer to the Lord,  milady?" he asked.

"Brings me further from the earth,  Javies."

"As milady says."

"I do wish they'd get this thing over  and done with."

Javies handed her a thin porcelain cup, and  poured tea into it. "Milady has never been much in favour of the races, as  I recall. Incidentally, I took the liberty of cleaning the tea kettle. Three  times, in fact. I believe it had gathered enough carbon to form the basis of  intelligent life."

She glanced at him and smiled briefly.  "Thank you, Javies. It's always good to have a diversion."

"Indeed, milady." Javies  retreated to the dinner table, where he began to polish the gold decoration on  the glass cups.

"I just don't like Keral taking time  away from his studies," Bethora said. "He needs to work hard."

"The children of men can never rest,  it seems, milady," Javies said, alluding gently to the status of Keral's  father. The man had been a notoriously hard worker, right until his untimely  death. Afterwards, Bethora had grown increasingly dissatisfied with Keral's  progress, constantly egging and pushing him to greater heights.

"It's for his own good," Bethora  said. "Life isn't easy."

Â Javies,  who had been a manservant for a long time and knew a few things about the  difference between royal and civilian life, said nothing.

"Besides, if his father were here,  he'd push the boy far harder."

"I'm sure he would, milady."

There was a knock. Javies walked over to  the door and greeted the guest, saying to Bethora, "Lady Raana here to see  you, milady."

The woman walked in. She wore a dress of  shimmering greens, and a golden necklace, both of which glimmered in the lights  of the quarter. She walked speedily over to Bethora, gave her a nervous smile  and said, "Bater sends his regards."

Bethora nodded. Bater was Raana's husband, a  man with sad eyes and clammy hands. Bethora had let him on top of her once, in  a weak moment, and had told him afterwards that if anyone ever found out, she  would have him castrated.

"Have you heard from Keral?"  Raana added.

"Only that he was getting ready, and  expected to win. How about Selan?" Selan was Raana's son, and would be aboard  the same ship as Keral in the race, acting as Keral's second-in-command.

"The same. I do wish those boys  weren't so eager. Competitiveness is all well and good, but one day they're  going to take it too far."

"Rather that than not far  enough," Bethora said.

"Oh, don't say that. I'm worried  enough as it is without having them be jinxed."

Javies interrupted. "I'm sorry, but could  I offer miladies some tea?"

"No, thank you, dear," Raana  responded. "I only popped round to wish everyone good luck."

"And the same to you," Bethora  said. She put her arm around Raana's shoulders. "They're going to be fine.  Stop worrying. I didn't raise Keral to let me down."

Raana looked at her. "I know you  didn't, darling," she said. "I know you didn't. At any rate, I'll be  off. The race should be starting soon, anyway." And with that, she took  her leave.

Several ships undocked. Each was a  different model, but shared the Amarrian characteristics: The lambent gleam on  golden hulls, the hawk-like curves, the quiet, majestic grandeur. They lined up  in a predetermined pocket of space and signed their readiness in the local communications  channel. A few moments later, the judges gave the starting call. The race was  on.

The rules were fairly simple. Each  contestant had to destroy a series of beacons. Each beacon, when destroyed,  would drop a marker that needed to be returned to station. Points of varying  measure were scored by destroying your beacon, returning your markers, destroying <em>other</em> people's beacons, destroying or  returning their markers, and performing any particular manoeuvres considered elegant,  flashy or dangerous enough. All beacons were fairly closely spaced, so there  was always a risk that your opponent might shoot down yours instead of going  for his own. As a result, ships needed to be fitted not only with sufficient  firepower to destroy the beacons, but also electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt  the targeting capabilities of other players. Not only that, but since each  marker was fairly sizeable, you'd need to fit cargohold expanders on your ship  if you wanted to haul more than a couple back to station at any one time; and  expanders would slow your ship down noticeably. Ship setups were kept strictly  secret, shown only to professional inspectors.

Keral was already in the lead. He'd spent  months practicing with Selan at his side, and the two commanded their ship with  admirable precision. Since the purpose of competition was to test the young  men's mastery of command, the ships were staffed only by regular crews, not by capsuleer  pilots.

Eventually, it came down to a single  beacon. Keral and Selan's ship, the Apollyon, was just barely ahead, racing toe  to toe with another ship. The Apollyon started going faster, and faster, and  faster still, firing on the beacon and hitting with incredible accuracy at that  range. It managed to destroy the beacon, but for some reason its guns kept  firing, into empty space, and a commentator noted that if they kept that up  something was sure to burn out. The Apollyon rushed onward to pick up the  marker, but when it got in range, it didn't slow; instead, it kept going,  overshooting its prize. It tried to turn, but inertia had it in an inexorable  grip, and as the spectators watched in shock, it crashed into a nearby  asteroid.

<p align="center">***</p>
They were at the station's medical  quarters. Bethora sat by her son's side, in silence. He was being kept  unconscious. His friend Selan had died earlier the same night.

The head doctor approached her. "The  scan results are in, milady. I'm very sorry to tell you this, but with the  internal injuries your son has sustained, it's almost certain that he won't  last the night."

She glared at him.

He continued. "We'll do everything we  can to make your stay here as comfortable as possible-"

"There is something else you can  do," she said. "You can help my son."

"I'm sorry," the doctor said,  "I truly am. I can understand your reaction, but short of giving him a new  body, we're helpless. I strongly suggest you focus instead on the little time you  have left with your son."

Without breaking her gaze, Bethora got up  and stood very close to the doctor. "You are not listening to me,"  she said in a quiet tone. "Or yourself. There is something you can do. A  new body."

The doctor stared at her. Then he bubbled,  "That's, no, that's unheard of. Amarr royal skin is absolutely sacred."

"Is yours?" Bethora said.

The doctor fell silent.

"If my son dies tonight," she  said, "he will not be the only one. Nor will I stop there. Is that  clear?"

The doctor swallowed, and nodded.

"I know there are several facilities  in the area with clones on standby. My manservant will assist you in making the  necessary arrangements, including all steps needed for secrecy. My son <em>will</em> awake tomorrow, and make a  miraculous recovery."

<p align="center">***</p>
Bethora looked through the shatterproof window  set in the door. It was a week after the accident.

On the other side, Keral paced, tossing  things back and forth, screaming nonsensical dialogue from movies he'd once  seen, stopping every now and then to turn the lights in the room off and back  on. He had indeed made a miraculous recovery, but not a complete one. Brain  damage, irreparable, had ensued.

Her advisors had informed Bethora she would  have to keep her son out of sight for a while. Later, they would let rumours  slip out that the crash, combined with Bethora's harsh, cold treatment of her  son throughout his childhood, had resulted in such psychological trauma that Keral  might never recover. No one could ever find out that the cloning of sacred  Amarrian skin had taken place, nor that, with security procedures circumvented,  it had gone so disastrously wrong.

Bethora placed her fingers against the  glass. Her son, lost in whirlwinds, didn't even notice.

"You," someone said.

Bethora turned. In front of her stood  Raana, accompanied by two armed guards.

"What's this?" Bethora said.

"Why did the ship go faster than its  fittings should've allowed?" Raana said in a dead tone. "Why did its  guns keep on firing at nothing? Why didn't its shields buffer it from the  asteroid? <em>Why did my son die</em>?"

Bethora rubbed her eyes. "I don't know.  Why don't you go ahead and tell me, Raana?"

"I had the wreckage  investigated," Raana said. "Turns out it contained ship rig  prototypes. Since rigs are so new on the market, they haven't yet been allowed  in competition, but your son didn't care about that, did he?"

"What are you saying?" Bethora  said.

"The first prototypes for these things  wouldn't have shown up on the ship fitting screens, and so the inspector would never  know. But they were completely unstable and were never released to the public.  The only people who could've gotten their hands on those infernal machines were  those with special access. People like us.

"Your boy had this planned for ages.  He cheated, and it killed my son, and it was all because of you."

"Me?!"

"Who pushed him into this? Who never  let up? Who made him feel he was never good enough for anything?" Raana  said. "I don't know if you actively encouraged him to cheat, but it really  doesn't matter. You're responsible for all of this, Bethora, and I intend to  see you pay."

She raised a hand, and the guards stepped  forward.

Bethora steeled herself. "You don't  know what you're doing," she said.

Raana's eyes went wide and her face turned  pale with rage. "And <em>you</em> do?" she said. She stalked over to Bethora and jabbed a finger at the  window on the door beside them. "Look! Look at what you've done! You  wouldn't even let that poor boy rest in death."

"What do you mean?" Bethora  managed to say.

"You know exactly what I mean. It  doesn't take a genius to figure out," Raana said, then shook her head.  "My god, you're pathetic."

Bethora opened her mouth to say something,  thought the better of it, and walked past Raana, the guards following her with  hands on their weapons.

On the other side of the door, the boy  turned the lights on and off, on and off, on and off, on and off, on and off.
