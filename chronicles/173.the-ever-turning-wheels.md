# The Ever-Turning Wheels

![The Ever-Turning Wheels](images/turningwheels.jpg)
<p>When the dropships came, Jeb and I counted down the 
seconds to our deaths - if not from the invading forces, then from our own 
people, some of whom had sworn to die on their feet and take everyone with them, 
invader and traitor both. The traitors, apparently, were those unwilling to die 
rather than be yoked to the Caldari wheel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But the dropships landed, leveling entire hills with 
their impact, and once their chutes opened and the armies within marched out to 
meet us - the sun glinting off their metal carapaces, the dust rising in clouds 
from the synchronized thumps of their feet - nobody put up much of a fight.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jeb and I were still behind cover - there really 
didn't seem much point anymore, for if we'd wanted to be safe, we should have 
long since run for the mountains - and we watched as the Caldari troops marched 
over and through. They did not seem bound by the same gravity as we were.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We waited for shots that were never fired. A few 
people rushed madly towards the troops, some bearing weapons or facsimiles of 
same. I don't know if the Caldari were under orders to hold their fire or if 
they were merely that disciplined, but the last I saw of our rebels was a rising 
trail of dust, dwindling to nothing. They were enveloped by the army, disarmed 
and locked down. Some were left lying on the ground, handcuffed and immobile; 
others were carried, furious and unwilling, to the nearest bush or body of water 
and unceremoniously thrown in. The greatest offensive action they took against 
our people was gagging a few of the loudest rebels, which was likely more a 
relief to me than it was to them. There is nothing so unbearable as a shrieking 
rebel knowingly reduced to a powerless effrontery of words.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In a whisper Jeb asked me whether we were lost, and I 
didn't know what to tell him. A part of me - the rebellious part, I supposed, 
though it didn't feel quite so - wanted to say yes. Another, more sensible part 
suspected that we might have a new world on our hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were a backwater colony of the Gallente Federation, 
established so far back in time that historical records on our foundation were 
inconclusive. Our leaders, such as they were, maintained that this proved we had 
been there for a long time. Truth was, we'd likely just kept shoddy records.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For most of us it hadn't been the easiest life to 
live. Resources had always been scarce, and what little we eked out was strongly 
controlled by our local government. We did a smattering of trade with 
neighboring planets, but for the most part we kept our business to ourselves 
.Our government's fear of offworld dependency led to exorbitant taxation on all 
interstellar business, and the populace mostly, if grudgingly, supported this 
policy. In truth, we had learned not to desire what we could not easily acquire. 
We were a closed system - interconnected, complex and opaque - and in the myriad 
of monopolies, favoritism, backroom dealing and nepotism that we allowed to take 
place, we convinced ourselves that this was the only way to run a planet, and we 
took a strange pride in it; as if our corruption were emblematic of our 
independence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The factional wars caught us by surprise. On dark 
nights we would look up at the stars and see some of them moving at great speed, 
others bursting into flames. It was the capsuleers, of whom I'd only ever heard 
stories, engaged in battles I could not even begin to imagine. Fighting over 
control of territories - fighting, to my amazement, over us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were not used to being the object of anyone's 
plans, much less fought over with such ferocity. Reports would trickle in of 
Gallentean successes, Gallentean conquests and Federation Navy domination, which 
made us all the more nervous: We were not stupid, and even the more fervently 
nationalistic of us knew full well that we Gallente, for all our strengths, 
would not be doing all our fighting in Gallente systems such as our own if we 
were on any kind of path to victory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The trickle eventually dried up, and we began to speak 
in hushed voices. Not long after, the Caldari came.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
<p>The highest echelon of Gallentean rule over our colony 
had been a unit of elitism unto itself. Neither I nor Jeb nor anyone like us 
could ever have hoped to breach it. At most, what we could have expected were 
individual rewards for services well rendered: perks and bonuses, applied like 
grease to our ever-turning wheels. It was obviously not a perfect system, and it 
was certainly not fair, but it worked for what it was. We could live with the 
strings so long as we felt that the right ones were being pulled at the right 
time, and that they were, within this opaque system, at least tolerantly 
transparent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was a poor system for a poor world, 
and when the Caldari came I knew I was a traitor, because in my heart I welcomed 
them. If it had been us descending on their world, we would have roared in with 
bullets; but they came in silence, swift and efficient, and with the simplest of 
strokes they lopped the head off our ailing body. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We protested, of course, some of us more viciously 
than others, but we did so in the knowledge that we couldn't possibly hope to 
enact any kind of change. As Gallenteans now subject to foreign rule it was 
utterly frustrating, but as individuals on a corrupt backwater colony it was - 
for me, at least - a guilty relief, couched in the hope that the new 
administration might bring some manner of equality and opportunity. While 
someone in the middle of the Federation proper might have felt more enamored 
with their rulers, and more energized to fight back against the invaders, out 
here the only thing that had made us Gallente were the banners on our 
governmental buildings, and the unspoken policies that it was every man for 
himself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new rule moved in. Our lives went on. Jeb and I 
had the same old jobs with the same superiors and the same responsibilities, and 
at night we each dreamt the same familiar dreams, perhaps a little clearer now, 
of riches and opportunities. It took a while for everything to settle, but 
eventually it did: The protests stopped, people kept working for their pay, and 
anyone who attempted in their own small way to overthrow the system was either 
imprisoned - briefly, without repercussions or mistreatment - or simply ignored.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And to my speechless disappointment, the Caldari - the 
efficient, disciplined, lockstep Caldari - began to screw it all up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first mistake they made was in announcing the new 
governorship. Gallente are used to having a voice, however much it may be 
ignored. Our new governor, a Caldari diplomat apparently experienced in running 
Caldari asteroid colonies, was installed along with his team of representatives 
as soon as he arrived planetside. Local broadcasts informed us of his expertise 
and implied that he would lead us to great things, but fell silent when it came 
to the details of his position: How long he would be installed, what the extent 
of his powers under the current regime, and exactly what changes might be 
forthcoming. The lack of information, coupled with the utter disinterest in 
involving the local population, did more to stir local rebellion than any 
invasive action could have. We had known we were powerless from the moment the 
armies landed, but that was a knowledge bound to its time, fixed in the moment 
of the silver armies marching towards us. This new development rang the first 
note for our future, and implied that our lives from here on would be subject 
entirely to the whims of an unknown, unknowable force.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All they would have needed to do was hear us out. Ask 
our opinion, pretend to listen; and all would have gone so much better. Instead, 
they doomed themselves to rule over a populace that was already pessimistic over 
its future, and saw no reason to aid its masters in improving their own lot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It went on like this. The navy might have executed a 
clear-cut takeover, but the bureaucracy virtually stumbled its way into power. 
Gods knew our old rule had not been faultless, but at least we had grown inured 
to its flaws. Then the Caldari had come in and done the worst thing they could: 
Brought about change, but extinguished the hope that it might be for the better.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jeb and I kept a close eye on the new power, as anyone 
else would. We read the council minutes, spoke courteously to representatives, 
and kept our mouths shut while taking in all the information we could.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The more we learned, the clearer it became that this 
was not a failure of the meritocracy, that guiding light of the new Caldari 
rule.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead, it was the fault of our new governor, who had 
overseen every process following the invasion itself, and who was clearly not 
fit for rule. His people were just as corrupt as the old rule, but possessed 
neither the personal connections nor the deep understanding of colony life to 
make the community function underneath all that graft.</p>
<p></p>
The Gallentean in me took over.

<p></p>
<p>I kept an eye on everything, saw the myriad of 
problems, and noted down ways to fix them. My own job, as a low-level 
facilitator, afforded me an opportunity to travel, so I made the most of it. I 
did not ask questions about work or anything else that might be deemed 
suspicious; but then, I didn't have to. All I did was ask people about 
themselves. Eventually their talk moved on to work, and most all were entirely 
happy to tell me of all the wrongs that could be righted, as people tend to be 
when they're talking to someone who they believe is just as powerless to act as 
they are. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It took weeks, and the only one I shared it with was 
Jeb, who seemed to agree with most of what I thought. Long, sleepless nights of 
planning; and long, careful days of finding the right people to talk to, the 
right chinks in the armor to slowly dent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually the call came in. The governship -the 
governor and a good deal of his entire team - were to be replaced. The colony 
had stabilized, they said - which was true - and it was now possible for them to 
pull out the governing force and replace it with local people. All of this was 
true. Not a mention was made of the utter failures that had taken place during 
the governor's brief time in office. They were not important any longer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Names were mentioned. Mine came up; once, then again, 
then often enough that the voices lifted me to power.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'm not at the top yet - the apex belongs to the 
Caldari - but I've risen to one of the highest positions a Gallentean can hold 
on this colony. Jeb's not far behind me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's been a strange time. It has taught me more than I 
cared to know about how this place is run, and what a labyrinthine task it can 
be to pull the strings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The meritocracy is a real, wonderful thing. It's what 
we always wanted. Performance matters. If you are good at what you do, you are 
rewarded; and if you are not, you are pushed aside to make way for someone who 
can do your job. It's a utilitarianism that by rights should have arisen with 
the Gallente. That it did not, bubbling instead out of that black stew that is 
the Caldari corporate world, is testament to their ability to adapt, and a great 
discredit to ours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And in this new world they allow us to create, I still 
cannot help but wonder if the legacy of Tibus Heth, that high warlord of the 
Caldari State, and his quest to destroy the Gallente Federation by any means, 
isn't still being furthered. For the numbers have come in, and they are the same 
ones as they were yesterday and the day before.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The colony operates better than ever. The people will 
brook nothing less, now. Anyone who fails to serve the meritocracy and its 
people at the level it demands can not be allowed to block the path of others.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The numbers have come in. I've known Jeb since we were 
kids.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is how they will turn us against one another. And 
I don't know how to be a Gallentean any more.</p>
