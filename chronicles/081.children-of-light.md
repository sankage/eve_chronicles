		To the Caldari merchants that shuttled between the core systems it was
		considered a good omen if, on approaching the Iyen-Oursta stargate, they might
		witness the hypnotic ballet of the Lutins. Some Gallente locals even took to
		worshipping these strange dancing lights, that would on rare occasions surround
		an approaching ship like a swarm of angels until the jump to Perimeter was
		made. The more belligerent of the Amarrian traders meanwhile saw them as mere
		baubles, strung up in space to calm the women, children and slaves before the
		warp drive's wrench pulled them briefly into timeless non-existence.

	<p>
		Rumours had spread across the Border Zone of vengeful ghost drones returning
		from the climactic battle at Iyen-Oursta, perhaps to enact a haunting toll for
		the Caldari secession a century previous. Conspiracy theorists, as is their
		way, held that the spectral phenomenon was evidence of Jove experiments.
		Ironically, it was the dismissive Amarrians who capitalised most -- on the
		widening belief among Minmatar slaves that if they witnessed the spectacle of
		lights, their firstborn son would be blessed with freedom.</p>
	<p>
		Despite the fact that the detour sometimes doubled the length of their journey,
		slaver vessels would divert through the Gallente Border Zone in the hope that a
		sighting - staged or otherwise - would serve to quiet an obstreperous cargo.
		Some slavers lent the spreading belief further credence by freeing the Luti,
		the children subsequently born of 'blessed parents'. Others weren't as
		compassionate, taking instead to neutering their human cargo, often by
		furtively poisoning the ceremonial Kapli bread baked in honour of a Lutin
		blessing.

	<p>
		Whilst a few scientific studies were conducted on the phenomenon (or 'Iyen
		Pixies,' as they became colloquially known), efforts were half-hearted.
		Welcoming the income afforded by the increased traffic, the Amarr Empire
		exerted its pressure on the academic community. In the end, even the most
		inquisitive of academics were dissuaded from seeding their sensor arrays around
		the increasingly busy node.
	</p>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, among pockets of forced-migrant Minmatar workers, the legend
		continues to flourish. Kapli bread is still baked by those hoping for release
		from captivity across plantations and farms everywhere, and in a quiet corner
		of San Matar, on the darkest day of the year, the Lutinlir, ('Festival of
		lights') attracts thousands of Luti families now living in the relative freedom
		of the Ammatar enclave.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of the widespread theories put forward through the years to explain the fabled
		Lutins, the one most favoured by the scientific community is that of
		superheated plasma escaping through poor venting from the stargate itself. It
		is thought that if approached at the right speed, correct angle and proper warp
		drive frequency, the vented plasma is attracted away from the jumpgate's boson
		sphere and towards the approaching ship. According to the theory, the plasma's
		reaction to the ship's shields is what creates the brief, dazzling and harmless
		display of multispectral lights.
	</p>
	<p>
		Over time, perhaps due to the advances jumpgate technology has seen over the
		years, the number of sightings has dropped considerably. Of the few reports
		that are made, most are dismissed as elaborate hoaxes. As a consequence, the
		Iyen-Oursta system has become something of a quiet bypass for traders as
		opposed to the highway it once was. Still, every once in a while, a hopeful
		soul may be seen roaming around the gate, wishing for a glimpse of that fabled
		beauty.
