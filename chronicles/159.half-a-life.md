# "Half a Life"

They were finishing up a patrol in EC-P8R when they   were told of fresh meat.
  

Antar's team had been doing hunt-and-grabs for a while   now, and he had become a natural at Bleeding his victims. The experience   depended on one's training, origins and constitution - common wisdom held that   anyone who didn't pale and grow nauseated at their first time of hooking up live   bodies was either perfect for the job or too crazy to be allowed on a spaceship   - but for every Raider there eventually came a point when, even if the horror of   the thing lurked at the back of one's mind, it had at least become a tolerable   experience.
  

It was not about suffering, although that could   certainly be a part of the process. It was done as much for the victims as for   the Blood Raiders themselves. Antar loved seeing the full spectrum of emotions   they went through: From utter and abject fear, through disgust and hatred and   denial, even bargaining and making offers, stunning offers; all the way to calm   acceptance and a quiet, gently fading serenity. He was making them whole at   last.
  

He checked the equipment they'd set up on the ship,   which had not been his when they boarded. Vital signs were stable. The   sterilized containers were slowly filling.
  

It was about completing a cycle, really. He mopped off   some stray drops of blood, and stroked the cooling cheek of one of the people he   had met on this journey. Everything was a journey. It was amazing. He didn't   want to reach the end, ever, even though he felt uneasy whenever he wasn't   hurtling down the path towards it.
  

The ship had turned so quiet. All Antar heard was the   shuffle of his fellow Raiders, moving about between the donors in repose. He   envied those donors. Antar had been one of the Amarr Empire's chosen ones, a   Holder in service to the Lord and the Empire's Chamberlain, and he had thrown   himself into the role with fervor. But the part had been only that; a section of   a whole, insufficient to fulfill his needs. The more he sought piety, which was   a road without end, the less he felt like a human being. The honor and the faith   had granted him only half a life.
  

An encounter with Chamberlain Karsoth had changed   everything, and given him access to the other side of life. He had discovered   not only entire new vistas of existence to explore - of indulgence in sin, of   terror in extremity - but, in this new darkness that fed him, he had found   completion of the pious side, too. At last he could fill in the gaps of good   that had been missing all along; giving mercy, for instance, to the victims of   the Bleeding, or making sure that they could hold their children in their arms   during their last moments. It was a work of delicate care, far more so than   outsiders might think.
  

Which made the message he'd just received all the more   interesting.
  

Antar was told to have his team immediately break   rank. They were to take two ships and follow a Sisters of EVE vessel that had   departed the Sisters HQ for some unknown destination. They were to shadow this   vessel on its journey, making sure not to attract its attention, much less try   to harvest it. And they were to go right this minute, leaving the uncompleted   Bleeding to a replacement vessel that was on its way.
  

Despite Antar's annoyance at leaving a task   unfinished, he was excited. Everyone liked the manic thrill of the chase, even   if they had to stay hidden. The Raiders traded in image, and it was not unheard   of for ships to simply stop moving when they arrived on the scene, waiting   instead for what they hoped would be a painless death. Others would fight back   viciously, and the utter terror in their eyes when their ship was finally   boarded gave Antar such an adrenaline rush that he often tasted blood in his   mouth.
  

They were used to being a bit more subdued when the   Sisters were involved. The Raiders called the Sisters their "little hunters" and   had learned to heed their movements, tiptoeing around them if necessary. It was   a parasitic relationship that darkened the Sisters' name and greatly shamed   them, and it was kept in utter silence among their faction, for which Antar   truly pitied them. Where the Sisters went, there would be injury and hurt,   terror and fire; and there would be blood.
  

Nonetheless, nobody on his committed team liked   leaving a task unfinished. Their leaders knew this, and there was a tone of   urgency in their new order that registered with Antar. He ignored the grumbles   of his team and the whispered pleas of the bleeders, packed up whatever gear he   needed and left the ship to its fate. Soon they were off, the remains of their   collective annoyance giving way to the quietly brimming excitement of the chase.
  

And then they ran into the goddamn Thukkers.
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

One of the captains leading the Thukker protective   force was named Kotan, and it was his lot to meet the incoming threat.
  

He was part of a team flying protection for a small   caravan of traders and merchants, all on their way to check out the new arrivals   in the Great Wildlands. Thukkers lived on the move, passing from system to   system in a great, unending exodus of motion. They were as close to living off   the land as anyone could be in this dead wasteland space. Kotan cared greatly   about his people - a dangerous quality not many people can truly say they   possess - and did not want them to come to harm.
  

So when he spotted the Blood Raiders, he immediately   took his team on the offensive. In his mind the Raiders were like leeches,   completely impossible to detach once they sunk their poisonous feelers into the   flesh of their prey. Kotan hoped that a powerful offensive would hold them off   long enough to save the caravan, or at least keep them from calling in more   troops.
  

They started the fight, and it was the strangest one   Kotan had ever been involved in.
  

The Blood Raiders charged as they always did, fearless   and mad, but their maneuvers were far from the risk-taking insanity Kotan had   learned to expect from them, and their laser fire was highly conservative. They   immediately locked on to almost all ships under Kotan's command and started   firing, an action that hopelessly spread their cumulative power. Kotan's own   vessel found its shields dented somewhat, but nothing of any concern.
  

It got stranger when he pushed on with the offensive.   The Blood Raiders took their hits, as they always did, but the moment Kotan   managed to down the shields of one of their vessels, that ship would retreat   from range even at the cost of its own accuracy. Kotan called in reports from   other ships around him, and they all reported the same situation. The Blood   Raiders did not want to fight. They were putting on a show.
  

He ordered his own forces to back up and see what   happened. The Blood Raiders followed, but retained the strange dispersed attack   that still wasn't doing anything at all. They still allowed Kotan's people to   hit their shields, but not a single dent had been made into their armor so far.   And as the Thukker forces retreated, the Raiders still did not move in for the   kill.
  

They did not want to be here. There was no other   possibility in Kotan's mind. They were on their way to somewhere more important,   somewhere that offered bigger rewards than an entire Thukker caravan full of   innocent people, and they were putting up a mock fight so that the Thukkers   wouldn't catch on.
  

Kotan did not like that. Nor did he like the   realization budding in his mind, that he could not merely fight off these   horrors only to go back to protecting his own people. He had seen what happened   to those who fell prey to the Blood Raiders, and what remained of them after   they had been used up and sucked dry. The thought that they might be on their   way to do this to someone else, no matter who, was too much to bear.
  

At the same time, something else rankled him about   this. The Blood Raider force would give anyone a challenging fight, but he had   no idea where they were headed, nor who to warn of their arrival. They could   have passed him by and the most he would have done would be to warn the Sisters   of EVE, the one force whose mobility came anywhere close to the Thukkers', that   there might be a bloodbath. But the Raiders apparently wanted to continue   operating under cloak and darkness.
  

This was wrong, Kotan felt, and it could not be dealt   with using normal means.
  

He resolved to follow.
  

Thukkers were trained to handle unforeseen   circumstances, and encouraged to rely on their judgment and intuition. There was   only so much systemization you could nail down in an intangible society. Even   the most diligent of captains would eventually find him- or herself out in the   middle of unknown space, faced with a completely unexpected situation and   pressed to make a decision based on insufficient or unreliable data. You did   what you needed to do, and you didn't hesitate in taking action. This was being   a Thukker.
  

The Blood Raiders let their shields drop low, as Kotan   knew they would, and eventually retreated. Kotan ordered the other vessels on   his team to return to the caravan and protect it, and had his own ship do the   same. Once the Raiders had nearly dropped out of sight, Kotan ordered the ship   swung around and sent a brief note to the caravan leader that he was off to   investigate an anomaly. To his surprise, another fighter broke rank and followed   him. He sent off a message informing them that they were free to return to the   caravan, and the captain of the other ship, who had served with him for a while,   replied with a message that stated, quite simply, they were damn well free to go   on wild goose chases, too.
  

Kotan grinned at that as he set off to follow the   Raiders. He had his screen show him the caravan, which slowly disappeared from   view as they started their hunt. It felt like he was leaving more behind than he   could ever imagine.
