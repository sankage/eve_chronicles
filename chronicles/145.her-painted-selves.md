# Her Painted Selves

<p>
</p>
<p>Even at this height, where Braea felt a twinge of 
sickening dizziness, the roars of the crowds below could be heard. They were 
muffled through the polycarb glass, and when one of many assistants urged Braea 
to step closer to the edge of her sealed balcony overhanging what seemed like 
the world below, she got the momentary impression that she could simply keep 
walking: Out through the glass, into the air and through the station ceiling, 
out into space and into the unknown and unending dark. She had to stop herself 
from taking another step lest she bump into the glass wall. The cameras would 
capture that, as they did everything else, and she couldn't imagine the hundreds 
of thousands down below all laughing at her.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The floor was carpet-clad but the walls all around 
them were transparent, and everywhere she looked down below she saw countless 
tiny heads, like little fallen stars, all of them looking either up at her or at 
the massive quartet of video screens that hung above her crystal enclosure and 
flashed her image to the four corners of this floating world. She ventured a 
quick look up, but the sight of herself cast on those screens gave her even more 
vertigo than the heights had done.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In that brief glimpse she saw the camera zoom out from 
her face and show her entire figure in that tight dress she hated. She'd put on 
weight, first from the stress of what happened to Gerets and then as comfort 
against the shock when he got back. It was nothing that an expensive designer 
couldn't fix, she'd been told, but she knew her own body and she knew what she 
was. Most of the time, at least.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She quickly looked back down and cast a glance at 
Gerets, who stood beside her and had not made a sound. In this place, with the 
crowd's overbearing adoration of them and what they stood for, it felt easier, 
more real, to look at his face, destroyed as it was. It was not their first 
public appearance after Gerets' checkout from the rehabilitation ward, but she 
was continually amazed to find herself here.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gerets was her fiancé. He was a member of the Gallente 
armed forces. He had been stationed on Caldari Prime during the invasion. 
Orbital bombardments had hit his barracks, killing everyone else. He'd been so 
disfigured that they had to use RNA scans to confirm his identity. That's what 
had happened, and that was how it was. She had to accept that.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>His face looked like a child's paper drawing of a man 
that had been smudged with water and grime before being crumpled into a ball and 
flattened out again.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She bit her lip, hard. This was how it was. No panic 
and no backing out.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>His costume covered him from neck on down, but Braea 
knew what lay beneath.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He would be fixed, but not for quite a while, for it 
was on him to be the symbol of perseverance and strength in the face of stark, 
brutal reality. This was what they'd done to Our Boys, all the reason we needed 
to go out there with fire and thunder. After some time - maybe a year or two, or 
three or four, they'd been told - he would quietly be given the funds needed to 
fix himself, followed by a total news blackout on him.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She looked to her side and pretended to wave, sneaking 
a glance at the capsuleer who'd hid in their entourage. He stood off-camera, 
looking like one of many assistants. His cranial socket was covered with a skin 
patch which in turn was concealed under a tight hood. He'd showed them the setup 
when he first came into the deal, explaining that while some people would 
undoubtedly guess his identity, it shouldn't be publicly acknowledged by anyone 
on the team. The capsuleer had offered an unknown addition to the funds the 
Federation had earmarked for Gerets' operation, enough to secure him a watcher's 
position in the press circus that surrounded the couple. He wasn't shy about his 
support, though its scope was unrevealed, but this effort wasn't supposed to be 
about him.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They had agreed, as they had agreed to so much, 
initially for the hope of a new beginning and eventually for the raw need for an 
end.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The show ended and they all headed off for the VIP 
greeting session. The Federation had made substantial advances in the direction 
of total conquest, the news had said, and whatever else those advances were, 
they were undoubtedly absolute reason for rejoicing.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On their way into the main floor of the skyscraper, 
one of the tallest buildings on the station, some of the assistants quietly 
asked Gerets to follow them to the makeup section. There would be press.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Braea turned to follow them, but the capsuleer touched 
her elbow. "We're taking a little side route."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She furrowed her brows. The capsuleer said, "We'll get 
to makeup soon enough, and Gerets'll still be there." He looked towards Gerets 
and she followed his gaze. The skin on her fiancé's neck had gone reddish and 
some of the pustules residing on it had pushed their way out, dotting a flabby 
skin fold that dangled limply over his neckline.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Braea stared at his neck, then walked up to him, 
gingerly put a hand on his shoulder and said she'd be right along.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gerets turned and looked impassively at her, then 
looked away and kept walking.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She told herself, for the thousandth time, that this 
sullenness was his nerves, nothing more than his nerves and the regimented 
behavior taught in the army, and not a lack of caring. Then she followed the 
capsuleer down another path.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They walked down a long corridor inset with soft light 
and entered a private elevator that took them down only a few floors. The 
elevator had one-way glass. Braea looked out, unseen at last.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"We can dim it both ways if it makes you feel queasy," 
the capsuleer said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She blinked, looked at him, then said, "No, no. It's 
not that."</p>
<p>
</p>
He leaned his head to one side, but said nothing more.

<p>
</p>
<p>They left the elevator and walked out onto a floor 
that was one huge space, stretching throughout at least a third the length of 
the building. It was beautifully laid out, with touch-sensitive pads that left 
heat-signature tracks of her steps; furniture of leather and wood; and hologram 
paintings on the walls. Braea looked hard at each painting she passed, more than 
anything to take her mind off the world, and something began to catch her eye. 
It took her a moment, but eventually she spotted it in every one. That one rogue 
element: Herself. Hidden somewhere in the room would be cameras that took her 
image, processed it for presentation, and strategically projected it in the 
landscape of the paintings. She was an underwater diver, a resident in a 
dirtworld farmhouse, a captain of a spaceship. All the unwitting roles for her 
to play, a star even less real than the scenery.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She nearly bumped into the capsuleer. He'd stopped and 
was gesturing for her to take a seat in one of the leather couches. Leather, 
like wood, was a commodity on the stations and one she felt decidedly 
uncomfortable with, but the seat he was directing her to had a worn appearance 
and its leather surface had hairline cracks. "My favorite reading spot," he 
said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She realized he was trying to help her feel relaxed 
and the small gesture set her at ease. She sat. "Is this someone's apartment?" 
she asked him. "Is it yours?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He sat beside her, at a respectable distance. "Yes, it 
is. This is the entryway."</p>
<p>
</p>
"How much of this floor is yours?"

<p>
</p>
<p>"All of it," he said. "But I didn't bring you here to 
impress you."</p>
<p>
</p>
She doubted it, but said nothing.

<p>
</p>
"How did all that fanfare make you feel?" he asked.

<p>
</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes and remained silent. Although 
he'd been in the project almost from the start and had remained affable 
throughout, he was a capsuleer. She and everyone she knew had an ingrained awe 
of his kind that was equal parts fear, admiration, distrust and wonder. The gulf 
that existed between him and everyone else was not easily bridged.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Also, she didn't yet know what he wanted out of all 
this. His monetary gift to the program had been quite substantial.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Also, she was very tired, not least of being stared at 
by people with ideas in their head about who she was.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"It's uncomfortable," he says. "Doesn't really feel 
like it's really you they're seeing or want to see. I know how that is."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She debated how forthright she could be with him and 
decided to try the waters. "Not to be ungrateful, but how I feel is a little 
complicated and I'm not at all sure I understand it myself yet. Is there a 
reason we're here? I should be with my husband."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"He's only your husband to be," the capsuleer said. 
His tone would have felt insultingly dismissive to Braea, but it struck 
something that she was too bright to write off as mere pride. "That's the big 
part of the news, isn't it?" he continued. "You two, despite everything, still 
aiming to get married sometime in the near future. I don't even think you've 
picked a day, have you?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"We did," she said. "But after ... after what 
happened, it's all up in the air."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm told you were convinced to put it off. Some 
war message agents came over. Guys who thought our supportive masses would like 
the idea of the girls supporting our troops but wouldn't quite want to confront 
the idea of what would happen on the wedding night. And you know what? That 
delay is actually a good thing."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She firmly ignored thoughts of the wedding night and 
focused on the capsuleer. Whatever he was leading up to it felt like he was on 
her side, though whatever side that was she didn't know yet. "Is it?" she said, 
then bit her tongue.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He smiled again. "It is, actually. The fanfare is 
necessary for the people, but you'll find they really don't care about the 
aftermath. Aside from a few newsmen scrounging for follow-up human-interest 
stories, you'll soon be pushed out of the limelight, never to return."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She looked down. "Maybe that's for the best," she said 
quietly. She felt so tired.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Maybe for some," he said. "But I've got my own ideas, 
and the ability to follow through on them. Half the money is yours, by the way."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Thanks," she said. She'd heard this said before. 
Unity and strength; we all stood by each other's side.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I'm not speaking figuratively. Today's reception is 
the last in this grueling press run you've been on for the last few weeks. Once 
you finish it, half the funds allocated to you and Gerets will be put into 
savings that he can rely on, released in substantial installments over several 
years, and will cover not only his rebuilding procedures but practically 
anything else he might desire. He'll get a new body and a better life to live it 
with.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"The other half of the money is yours and will become 
immediately available. It's registered to you and is yours to handle as you see 
fit. You have no more duties. Not to me, not to the government or the press, not 
to the people, not anyone," he said. "Not even your fiancé."</p>
<p>
</p>
She stared at him, not knowing what to say.

<p>
</p>
<p>The capsuleer said, "People can be regrown. I've been 
destroyed enough times to know that, and I understand the process better than 
most. One day, a while from now, Gerets will be rebuilt. It'll take a long while 
and will be agonizing even for a man who's experienced plenty of pain already, 
but it'll happen, at least on a physical level. There'll be physiotherapy and 
there'll be bad days that slowly get better.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"But there's nothing that can be done for the spirit. 
That'll have to take care of itself for now. Therapy will help, but after you've 
been broken and rebuilt, well..." He raised his hands, palms upwards. "You're 
never the same."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Why are you doing this?" she said in a whisper. On 
the wall, her painted simulacrums leaned down with her, nearly invisible in the 
colorful backdrops.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The capsuleer leaned forward too, resting his face on 
his hands. "You're a very pretty young woman, and I say that as someone who has 
absolutely zero interest in you in that way. You could have your choice of men, 
but you chose this one and you stuck with him. Until now it's been out of love 
and duty. After this point, it could've been out of duty still, or possibly out 
of darker motivations."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"If you're implying it was all for the money-" she 
said, but he interrupted. "No, I'm not. It's for the duty, and for what you once 
had, and for what you might have in some imagined fantasyland. But you've got 
smarts behind that pretty face and you know as well as I do that with this kind 
of commitment there comes self-doubt, even self-hatred, and a twisted kind of 
loyalty that you can never quite gel to. If you stay with Gerets while he's like 
this, not just physically deformed but mentally scarred over it, you risk 
turning yourself into a martyr and poisoning everything you might have had with 
him." </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Do you want me to leave him?" she said, a small 
tremor in her voice. "I can't. I can't do that."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Let me tell you something," he said. "The people who 
organized this, as far as they're concerned, Gerets is no hero. He's a terribly 
unlucky everyman, chosen to be a poster boy of what the enemy did to our people 
and handed a little bone to chew on as a thanks. Before I came into this deal, 
the plan was to stagger the release of regrowth money so much and thrust it 
behind such masses of red tape that you'd effectively have been serfs of the 
government in perpetuity. I brought in ten times what they'd set aside for you, 
and even that amount is less than I can make in a day. You owe them nothing, nor 
me, nor anyone else.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"You're not doing this out of sympathy alone," she 
said in a cold tone.</p>
<p>
</p>
He raised an eyebrow. "I'm not?"

<p>
</p>
<p>"I noticed the hints you dropped during the 
procession. Even if you know what it's like for people to think of you as 
something you're not, it wouldn't have made you do all this."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He regarded her for a while. His expression quivered 
slightly, and Braea realized he was trying not to smile. Eventually he said, 
"Well, you're right. In my defense,altruism was a real factor in my offer. But 
there's more to it; of course there is.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I've been hurt, and deformed, and even killed. I've 
woken up in a clone vat more often than I can recall. I've never gone through 
what Gerets will, but I've been burned nonetheless." He leaned forward again. 
"There comes a point, Braea, where you're so far gone that you lose the ability 
to reach out to the people who matter. When you reach that point, having someone 
who's there only out of the duty and the darkness, and not out of pure and 
unfiltered love ... well, that someone will make you want to stay inside and 
wait for them to go away."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He took her hand. "How long's it been since Gerets 
touched you?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She pulled her hand away, and looked at the walls. All 
her colored selves looked over their shoulders, too.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The capsuleer said, "If you think he doesn't know 
what's going on-... no, if you think he can't <i>see</i> how you feel, that he 
doesn't know every thought in your head, you're dead wrong. I spoke to that 
young man. He's bright. Morose, naturally, but still very bright, and he pays 
attention. And he's in terrible, terrible pain that you're only going to make 
worse if you stick around and force yourself to pretend that everything's the 
same."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Then what do I do?" Braea said, still not looking at 
him.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I had someone who clung to me. She did it for glory, 
me being a capsuleer, and even after I'd had my head scrambled by too many 
clonings in too little time, even when I made her life this absolute 
passive-aggressive hell, she still hung on. And eventually what was left of the 
love evaporated, because even as I wasn't the same person anymore, neither was 
she. The balance changed and she changed with it."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He stood up. "I want you to do what's right. This does 
include being to Gerets what he needs you to be, but to be honest, that's a 
secondary concern. You shouldn't carry him any more than you should carry a 
banner for the government's propaganda. Your duty is to yourself, always, and 
only to others through that. If you can be to Gerets what you want to be, then 
do it. If not, well, now you have a choice, and an obligation to realize that 
choice."</p>
<p>
</p>
She stood up. Her painted selves rose with her.

<p>
</p>
<p>He grinned slyly. "And heavens, you need makeup. Your 
cheeks are <i>streaked</i> with tears. You can't be seen like this; think what 
your husband would say!"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She let out a choking laugh. They walked back to the 
elevators. The tiles left tracks that gently faded in the wake of their passing.</p>
