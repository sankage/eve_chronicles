<p>
</p>
<p>When he dropped the golden vial, Antar knew he was a 
dead man.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They were in the garden of contemplation, Lerenge and 
he, arguing about the tenets of faith and their service to the Chamberlain. Both 
of them were privileged Holders who had done a lot of work in the royal court, 
and the constant friction of daily interaction had filed them into two smooth 
blocks of solid rock, smashed for so long against one another that they grated 
past with a minimum of fuss and agony, each waiting for the other to finally 
crack and break.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Before the vial had even touched the ground Antar was 
already kneeling for it, his fingers reaching for its shiny surface and his mind 
working on some suitable excuse. By the time he'd snatched it up again and put 
it in his pocket he had already decided not to say anything at all, and prayed 
instead that Lerenge would think the fallen object had been one of the golden 
buttons on his robe.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And Lerenge didn't seem to notice, going on as he did 
about the futility of self-devotion when there were so many issues to be dealt 
with every day. "You don't get anything done if you're on your knees in prayer 
all day," he said. "The Empire expects results."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antar, who wanted to get out of this conversation 
before his trembling hands gave him away, forced himself to shrug and say, "Then 
I guess we'd better get to it." Lerenge sniffed at him and walked away.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Once he was alone, Antar walked over to one of the 
benches and sat down heavily. He felt the vial inside his pocket, pressing 
against his skin.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He had an appointment with the Chamberlain himself in 
less than a day's time. He needed to keep a clear head and not fill himself up 
with trash and paranoia.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So he'd gone into the garden of contemplation, picked 
his thousandth fight with a man who loathed him, and right in the middle of 
things he had started fiddling with the golden vial that contained his emergency 
supply of drugs. The golden vial that he had started bringing into the court for 
no reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He rubbed his face with his hands, then spread them on 
the bench, leaned his head back and listened to the susurrus around him, with 
closed eyes and progressively calming breath.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It was not in the nature of man to deny his own 
nature. He enjoyed sitting on this bench and having the sun stroke his face. He 
also enjoyed doing drugs, not merely riding their highs but suffering their 
calamitous drops as well.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>That last part had been a revelation. The pressure of 
living in high Amarr society, not to mention working for some of the most 
high-powered men in the Empire, was such that most everyone had to find some 
manner of release. This was natural and expected, and people dealt with it with 
prayer and piety. You were expected to suffer for your faith and that you did, 
meandering through the random mazes of humanity's constructs in the hope of 
finding enlightenment on the other side. The stress and the pressure meant that 
you had a need for God beyond the everyday.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But not everyone found themselves able to alleviate 
the stress through prayer, and sometimes would turn to self-flagellation. It was 
not uncommon for high-ranking officials to be seen on slow walks around the many 
gardens in the Chamberlain's courts, gingerly feeling their way towards benches 
or tables after an evening of bodily abuse. This was smiled at, if not actively 
encouraged, by the church.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Drug use was forbidden, as was imbibing too much 
alcohol, synthetic drinks or anything except the mildest brews. But to Antar it 
came to much the same. It made no <i>sense</i> to self-harm, nor to lose 
yourself in invocation, because both depended on your strength and willpower to 
see it through. When you gave your autonomy over to someone else as your faith 
demanded, Antar felt that the very least God could do in return was to provide 
an unblocked passageway to Him.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He had gone to the drugs out of frustration and shame 
at being unable to take the pressure, and out of unwillingness to devote himself 
to the increasingly useless prayer and pain-threshold testing. And in the 
aftermath of fugue and tremors, he found himself at last.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He was supposed to suffer and that he had certainly 
done, spending what felt like centuries in panicked agony of visions, sweats and 
paranoia. But when it wore off, all he could think of was to do it again. The 
highs gave him sacrament and the lows gave him vindication. It felt perversely 
like being closer not only to God but to himself as well: Being true to his own 
nature and true to the punishing demands of his faith, by enjoying life to the 
fullest and then suffering for it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It was the one and perfect way of achieving wholeness, 
and Lerenge had embraced it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He got up, brushed off his robes and looked around. 
The day was drawing to an end. Sunlight glinted off a nearby statue of a Slaver 
hound, cast in bronze. Its presence comforted him, for if God had created this 
vicious, merciless animal, then surely there must have been some concession on 
God's side to the animalistic nature of human beings.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antar headed towards his quarters. Tomorrow would be a 
demanding day and he needed to clear his head.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"My dear boy, so good to see you," the Chamberlain 
said. His antechamber glimmered in the early daylight. The ceiling was high and 
ended in tinted windows whose glass changed hue according to the strength of 
sunlight. In the afternoon it would be golden and regal, and in the early 
evening a bronzed blood red, but the mornings were bright and uplifting. From 
beyond came the sound of birds.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The walls were covered with icons: Woven tapestries 
illustrated with the crests of the five Heirs and beset with their iconic 
gemstones, small crests and smaller paintings of Holders that had performed high 
service to the Empire, and massive decorations of all sorts that depicted the 
glorious Emperors of ages past. There was barely room for God.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antar, still kneeling, murmured into his chest, "I am 
always at your service, Your Honor." There were no guards inside the room, which 
was not that unusual. They were for decoration as much as anything, and the 
Chamberlain often sent them out so he could discuss personal business.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"And so polite as well!" Chamberlain Karsoth said with 
a laugh. "I trust you've had a good stay in the palace quarters."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"They never fail to bring me happiness," Antar said. 
This was true. He'd emptied the vial last night and disposed of it for good. The 
visions had been quite marvelous.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"That's good to hear. I like hearing positive words. 
We should have more of that in this place, us pitiful, unworthy sinners."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antar remained silent. He'd always liked the 
Chamberlain, an opinion that had him in the minority among the court, but the 
man's conversation style was dangerously comfortable. A genial chat with the 
wrong word let loose could mean a trip to the cleansing pits.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Are you contemplating the heavens?" Karsoth asked him 
in silky tones.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Always, my lord," Antar said. "How may I serve you?"

<p>
</p>
<p>This time the Chamberlain did not answer. The silence 
was so complete Antar could hear his own heartbeats, and he realized with a tiny 
bloom of terror that the birdsong had fallen silent as well. The audioblocks had 
been set down.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He kept his eyes resolutely on the ground. Before him 
he heard the noise of the Chamberlain rising to his feet, the metal pistons in 
his legs hissing as they supported the man's frame. There was a thunk and 
another thunk, repeated at higher volumes as Karsoth walked closer. Perfume 
wafted over Antar.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"From this height I could take off your head," Karsoth 
said in the same quiet voice.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I believe you could, milord," Antar said, keeping his 
breathing as steady as he could. His legs trembled slightly, though whether from 
strain or panic, he didn't know.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Lerenge spoke to me last night," Karsoth said.

<p>
</p>
Antar said nothing.

<p>
</p>
"I had your chambers searched," Karsoth said.

<p>
</p>
Antar remained resolutely quiet.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Do you have something to tell me, servant of the 
Empire?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For the first time, Antar looked up and directly into 
the eyes of Chamberlain Karsoth, highest representative of the celestial court, 
supreme authority in the Amarr Empire, and the conduit to the living God.</p>
<p>
</p>
And saw something he recognized.

<p>
</p>
"Nothing you don't already know, milord," Antar said.

<p>
</p>
<p>Karsoth smiled and pulled something out of a pocket on 
his golden robe. Antar had no doubt that he fully knew what crimes Antar had 
committed, for the man's dark network of spies and information was vast, but 
seeing the vial in the Chamberlain's hands was still a shock; not merely because 
it was the final embodiment of Antar's doom, but he was absolutely certain that 
he had destroyed it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Show me how faithful you are, Antar," the towering 
Chamberlain said to him, that same strange smile still on his face. "Talk."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antar knew that whatever he said in here wouldn't 
matter. His fate would have been decided already, and his confession was no more 
than an amusement to the Chamberlain. Whether he begged, pleaded, threatened or 
cajoled, he would still end up in the cleansing pits. Nothing mattered now; but 
conversely, nothing was forbidden. Through the pounding noise of his heartbeat, 
there surfaced the realization that he was free to say what he wished, in this 
last confession.</p>
<p>
</p>
So he began to talk.

<p>
</p>
<p>In the silence he spoke of pain and punishment, of the 
fracture between body and spirit and of the ideal nobody could possibly fulfil 
unless they explored all facets of humanity. He told of the heavenly visions 
he'd encountered outside himself and the hellish aftermath of the fall back to 
reality. He confessed his constant, infinite, unyielding frustration with the 
Empire's insistence on denying itself the divine imperative to be animals.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At some point, through the fugue of quiet panic, he 
realized he had stood up and was looking the Chamberlain in the face. He kept 
talking.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And at last he stopped, falling abruptly silent like 
the last page turned. He felt clean and empty, like anything Karsoth could do 
would be an afterthought to a life already ended.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The giant man watched him for a long time, the smile 
on his face not completely faded. Then he leaned in, the supports on his legs 
creaking with effort, and said, "You are the man I've been looking for."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antar stared back, with a dull and uncomprehending 
mind.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Do you know what is going to happen to you, faithful 
one?" the Chamberlain asked.</p>
<p>
</p>
"I will die," Antar said. "Eventually."

<p>
</p>
<p>"That you will. But first you will follow me." Karsoth 
turned and walked to the wall behind his throne. For a moment he stood in front 
of a painting of someone Antar had never known.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>There was no sign; no laser outline, no shimmer and 
nothing that indicated a change. Karsoth merely gave a short grunt of 
satisfaction, walked towards the wall and melded into it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Not vanished, Antar's brain told Antar's incredulous 
eyes. The Chamberlain had not been abducted or turned invisible, but neither had 
he merely walked through a holograph. He had entered the wall as if it were a 
porous membrane, and the wall had melded itself to him, rippled and moved, and 
let him pass through.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Karsoth's face pushed back out, its surface area such 
a picture-perfect replica of the wall he'd entered that Antar could only make 
him out by the outlines of his jowls. "The passage is active for a few more 
seconds, acolyte," he said. "You come now or never."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Antar's feet took over from the rest of his stupid 
body and propelled him through.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>On the other side were ... people. They seemed to be 
enjoying themselves. There was no external lighting, but torchlight glinted off 
naked skin. Some of them were ingesting things.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Contrary to what you might believe, I am extremely 
faithful," Karsoth said, as if in passing. Antar nodded, unable to tear his gaze 
from the mass of humanity writhing in front of him. The air in the room was 
heavily perfumed, and the people were making low sounds. He felt light-headed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"But I despise the god of the people we serve, for it 
is not the one true god. He would encourage indulgence and unfettered belief."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"He?" Antar said absent-mindedly, not having heard a 
word.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Karsoth misunderstood him. "Or She. God can be 
anything you wish."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"What happens to these people?" Antar said, still not 
entirely back in reality.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Karsoth gave him a stern look. "What do you think 
happens?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Before I saw this, I would have said the cleansing 
pits," Antar replied. Karsoth grunted.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They watched the display for a while. In a controlled 
voice that betrayed the slightest of tremors, Antar said, "Milord, I should ask, 
for I expect the question includes me as well. What does happen to these 
people?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Karsoth put a hand on his shoulder and in a benevolent 
voice said, "They are forgiven, my son. And they go on."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Where, milord?" Antar said. He thought for a moment. 
This was Karsoth. "And in one piece?" he added.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Chamberlain laughed out loud, a raucous roar of 
noise that echoed through the room. "Yes, Antar, they'll be fine. They come here 
now and then to tell me news from the darker parts. Most are free to wander the 
court as they please, but they tend to prefer each other's company until they 
depart."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Quite, milord."

<p>
</p>
<p>Karsoth turned to him. "Understand, acolyte. There 
exist a people who think like this. I found them through much the same crisis of 
faith as you extemporized to me, a truth that defied the death you were staring 
in the eyes. I will send you to them now, as my emissary. You have served me 
well in the past, and you will serve even better in your new position."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Milord, I... - well, what is there to say? I serve," 
Antar said, and bowed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"So you will," Karsoth said. "There is an enemy out 
there that needs to be dealt with, for she stands against all that we are; not 
in innocence, which is easily enough countered, but a different kind of darkness 
altogether. You will never see her, for it would kill you, but you will hunt 
down the ones closest to her. And you will do it among your own kind at last."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Yes, milord."

<p>
</p>
<p>"So you will be off, but I need to know now - and 
believe me, I will see the lie on your face - do you <i>want</i> to go? Do you 
understand that you will leave behind everything you knew and disclaim every 
trace of the life you had?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Yes, your grace," Antar said. "Yes, yes, a thousand 
times yes. Who are these people?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Chamberlain Karsoth smiled. "They are called the Blood 
Raiders."</p>
