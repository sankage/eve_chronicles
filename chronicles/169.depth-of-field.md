# Depth of Field

<p>The noise was getting louder, and the air was running 
out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"What the hell was that thing?" Now that there was 
nowhere to go, Karin couldn't stop herself from pacing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It had torn through her ship's hull like it was 
tinfoil, exploding out into the vacuum. She'd seen it on the camera feed, 
bursting through the reinforced bulkheads of the central hold, and finally 
understood why Dagan had wanted a camera trained on a goddamn inert drone.</p>
<p></p>
God, he was probably dead, too.

<p></p>
<p>Of course, he could come back. The rest of them 
weren't that lucky.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"You're so damn calm all of a sudden. You're gonna 
die, too, you know." Neral was quiet, leaning against the wall where Karin had 
arranged her. Her eyes were closed, but her breathing was shallow, her face 
sheet-pale.</p>
<p></p>
"It seems quite likely, yes."

<p></p>
<p>"Fucking Dagan," Karin muttered. "I'm so sick of 
eggers."</p>
<p></p>
"You'll be free of them soon enough, hmm?"

<p></p>
"The hell is wrong with you?"

<p></p>
"I've done what I had to do. There's nothing left."

<p></p>
<p>The clang of metal on metal reverberated through the 
ship, over and over. Something was beating against the wall of their little 
harbor, and knowing what it was wasn't making her any more comfortable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It <i>was</i> getting louder. She'd swear it was 
almost through the bulkhead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"You need to know--" Neral gasped. "You need to know 
that they'll be coming for you now. They'll all be coming for you."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Who? Who--" Karin's words cut off, eyes widening as 
she saw Neral's gun. "Are you crazy? You can't shoot that in here!"</p>
<p></p>
"Can." And the report filled the room.

<p></p>
<p>Karin slowly, cautiously opened her eyes. She looked 
over at where Neral had been sitting, then quickly looked away. She turned her 
face away from the ruin that had been Neral, and faced instead her own 
destruction.</p>
<p></p>
It was almost through the door. It was--

<p></p>
"Hello! Anyone alive in there?"

<p></p>
CONCORD?

<p></p>
Had she known?

<p></p>

<p>Karin dragged Neral along the hallway, her progress 
painfully slow. She'd found the woman with a chunk of shrapnel in her gut, and 
Karin couldn't just leave her lying there. Her ship was collapsing around her, 
nothing she could do about it, but she'd be damned if she was going to let her 
ethics go the same way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And now she was trapped in the twisted wreck of her 
ship with a dying woman. </p>
<p></p>
A dying woman and that noise.

<p></p>
<p>The terrifying shriek of tortured metal and the 
groaning vibrations of the hull as it collapsed were bad enough, but it was the 
steady, metallic banging against the thinnest bulkhead of her accidental prison 
that was really freaking her out.</p>
<p></p>
She really wanted to be thinking about something else.

<p></p>
<p>Her mind caught on a story from her childhood, of 
monsters in the depths of her homeworld's seas—</p>
<p></p>
No, that wasn't any better.

<p></p>
<i>
</i><p>-- arms reaching out to strangle whole vessels, down 
under the weight of fathoms of water, death as certain as--</p>

<p></p>
<p>"Tahaki Karin," she thought, "you snap out of it this 
instant." </p>
<p></p>
<p>She contemplated the bristling heap of metal shards 
ahead, bent and broken support beams and plates barricading what should have 
been a hallway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She set Neral down gently, tried to slow her 
breathing. Normal. Do a mental inventory: What do you have on you?</p>
<p></p>
Wrench, hammer, screwdriver, pliers--

<p></p>
Leverage.

<p></p>
<p>She could get some of the debris off one of the 
interior walls, find a way around, get them to a pod--</p>
<p></p>
--<i>live through this</i>.

<p>When everyone's eyes were glued to the security feed, 
watching Dagan's precious drone burst free from the ribs of their ship, it was 
Communications Officer Neral's voice they heard over the com.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She sounded just as calm telling them to abandon ship 
as she always had announcing an incoming transmission.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It made it all the more surreal when Karin discovered 
Neral bleeding out in the ship's corridor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She'd suffered a massive stomach wound, and judging by 
the trail she'd left she'd barely been able to pull herself over to the wall.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Karin crouched by Neral's shoulder, reaching out to 
check her pulse, and nearly fell over when a sticky hand grabbed her arm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Neral's eyes opened, bright with fever. "Dagan… drone. 
Got to warn. My sisters. How?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Hey," Karin said. "Hey, it's okay, we'll get you out 
of this."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Wasn't supposed to. Never expected. To get out." 
Neral laughed, short and horrifying, a thick wetness in her voice. " Will now."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Neral grabbed desperately at Karin's arms. "They'll be 
coming after you now. They'll all be coming for you. Tell my sister—"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"You can tell her yourself," Karin said. "I'm going to 
lift you now, but it'll hurt. Brace yourself."</p>
<p></p>

<p>Dagan was on the line with her when the sirens started 
going off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Damn it," he said. "This is far too soon. I thought 
that thing was thoroughly offline."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"The drone? It was! I checked it over when you brought 
it onboard."</p>
<p></p>
<p>He switched her view to the security feed. It was 
powering up weapons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I'm getting out of here. You'll probably want to 
evacuate, too," Dagan said, as her door slid shut and she heard the locks 
engage. "Shame you won't make it."</p>
<p></p>
<i>
</i><p>Arrogant bastard, she thought, and headed for the 
ventilation ducts.</p>
