# Fedo Song

Once he'd had the remains of his ship towed  into the docking bay, Auduban disembarked with the box. He could hardly think  straight at this point; all that remained in his head was to get the light, the  burning light, to as many people as possible.

He staggered to customs, hoping he wouldn't  be picked out. He wanted a public place, with lots of people, for when he  opened the box.

Customs stopped him right away and pulled  him aside.

They asked him what was in the box. He  stared at them, trying to think of something believable to say. Whatever it was  he eventually blurted out, it wasn't enough. One of the customs people took the  box from him, set it on the ground and opened it. The man's eyes grew wide, his  mouth dropped open, and his face turned ashen.

Auduban sighed, reached into his pocket,  and clicked a button on his small remote.

The box lit up with the burning light.

His sect had  used Fedos as part of their cleansing rituals. He would now use them to cleanse  himself, to purify for the task at hand.

He lay down  in the ship's main corridor, naked and cold. He was having trouble keeping his  balance, and strange images constantly floated through his vision, but it was  all right. The Fedos needed no guidance.

He lay deathly still. Eventually, they  came.

<p align="center">***</p>
This was  goodbye. This was the burning of bridges. Auduban's friends were no longer  talking to him, and his family had thrown him out of the house. His fascination  with the Amarr had been fine with everyone - it was good to know your enemy - but  when it morphed into infatuation, things changed.

He thought  of nothing but Amarr. More specifically, he thought of nothing but <u>her</u>. Her  words of religious faith and devotion had touched him, and when he'd written to  her, and she'd responded, he'd felt like his life had begun anew.

The snow  crunched under his boots, and the spaceship ahead reflected a blinding glare.

He was  leaving now. With her. For the new life.

<p align="center">***</p>
The ship had  nearly imploded. Half its controls had blown out, and most of its infrastructure  had been torn to pieces like paper in a storm.

The crew was  dead, and what remained of their bodies had been scattered over the entire  ship, burnt and shredded almost beyond recognition.

Sanada was  dead, too. Auduban, who had just barely survived the blast, found what was left  of her in her quarters.

<p align="center">***</p>
Deep in the  bowels of the ship, surrounded by humming machinery, Auduban got to work. He  jammed, twisted, cut and hammered each rig into its proper location, with the  occasional help from heavy tools. It was ugly, ugly hackwork, but it would  simply have to do.

<p align="center">***</p>
This was the  tenth station in as many days, and yet again they'd had to flee. They were exhausted.  Each time, they'd been run off by angry protesters. Apparently there were some  who were angered by the apocalyptic message they preached, not realizing that  desperate times called for desperate words. Much to Auduban's disappointment,  some of those protesters had been Amarrians. One or two had yelled at him for  being a Minmatar, which he didn't mind, but the rest had focused their anger on  Sanada, accusing her of zealotry and extremism. Auduban couldn't stand that. Instead  of giving proper, constructive criticism against the message, they chose to harangue  the beautiful messenger.

It had  gotten too much for some of Sanada's followers. The group, already small, was  dwindling now. Auduban's devotion, already fierce, grew to fill the gap.

By the time  they got to the eleventh station, the crew had shrunk to a third of what they'd  started with, and of the several support ships that had followed, none  remained.

<p align="center">***</p>
It was  getting a little harder to breathe. Auduban could still move and think, but any  time he turned his head a little too fast, the whole deck started spinning.

<br clear="all">
He was the  only human survivor. The Fedos, though, hadn't just lived; they'd prospered.  Their containment fields had broken, and now they were crawling all over the  ship, gorging themselves on crewmember parts, and breeding.

Auduban  didn't mind the Fedos. As the ship's garbage chutes were bent and broken out of  shape, the animals were the only option left to get rid of much of the trash.  Usually the stuff'd be shunted into the ship's exhausts and burned to dust. Now  the Fedos ate it.

<p align="center">***</p>
In the storage  room were several unused rigs that Sanada's crew had liberated from other vessels.  Rigs were permanent alteration kits for ships; they improved the output of various  subsystems such as shields and weapon controls, and once inserted could not be  removed again. The insertion was only supposed to take place under controlled  conditions, preferably by a qualified professional.

They didn't  have qualified professionals here, and certainly didn't have controlled  conditions. Auduban had a little mechanical expertise, enough to know where to  plug in the stuff, but that was about it.

He picked up  a few rig units and headed into the heart of the ship, unsure of what he was  doing.

<p align="center">***</p>
The ship's  atmospheric controls were malfunctioning. Auduban figured it wouldn't be long  before they gave out completely. Perhaps they'd have just enough left for the  ship to hobble back to the nearest station, but he didn't care. There was  nothing for him there anymore. Nothing at all.

<p align="center">***</p>
"Nothing  I say will work," he said in desperation. "There's no way I can carry  our message the way you did."

She fell  silent at this.

"I  wish, I truly wish that we could show them what I saw in you," he said,  "but we can't."

"What  did you see in me?" she asked. When he hesitated, she added, in a gentler  tone, "<em>How</em> did you see it? What  was it that moved you beyond words?"

He thought  about this. Eventually, he said, "The light in you. That's the best I can  do. I looked at you, at your face, your eyes, and it was like you had an inner  light, suffused with purity, that shone through. And everything it illuminated  became a part of you."

"Big  words," she said, and he smiled.

"I wrote  it down once," he explained. "Still remember it."

"Then  we need to let them see the light," she said. "The light that shines  from me."

He nodded.  He looked around, casting for ideas.

That's when  he saw the flashlight.

<p align="center">***</p>
On his way  to the ship's core he passed the Fedo cages. Fedos were small omnivorous  animals, little more than a nervous system with a stomach, and looked like  slabs of meat with feelers. They had no sight nor hearing, communicating by  smell alone, and were used extensively for ship cleaning, their main diet  consisting of the waste that always accumulates on closed vessels. They were  kept in separate cages when not in use, as otherwise they'd breed endlessly and  fill up the ship. They were a reviled but vital part of any prolonged stay in  space.

Auduban squatted  in front of their cages. There was something so calming about watching them squirm  and wriggle. He wondered if humans felt more pleasure than lesser creatures  like this, if the complexity of the human mind allowed access to a deeper kind  of enjoyment in life. On the other hand, perhaps simplicity was the key to  pleasure, in which case creatures like the Fedos were way ahead of the game. They  could feel any kind of pleasure with far more purity than humans could,  unfettered as they were by complex emotions and doubt.

Â He realized that he'd been overcomplicating his  situation. They needed money, they'd get it from pirates, and so they needed a  stronger ship. And he had the solution right here. Straight line of logic, from  start to finish. Anything else was only a distraction.

He walked  on, rigs in hand.

<p align="center">***</p>
One day,  Sanada began to speak to him. "We need to bring them the light," she  said, her voice resounding in his head. "With all the force we can  muster."

"I  can't," he said. "I can't. I failed. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I can't  do this alone-"

"You  won't have to," she said.

He fell  quiet.

"I will  bring them the light," she said. "But I need your help."

Through the  haze of infected air and Fedo stink, he tried to clear his mind. "What can  I do?" he asked.

"Help  me speak," she said.

<p align="center">***</p>
Since the  Fedos had so much to eat, their emissions greatly increased. Auduban didn't  mind the stink so much. But coupled with the increasing lack of air, it was  beginning to make him feel quite odd. Quite odd indeed.

<p align="center">***</p>
Once he had  the rigs in place, he put away the tools, said a silent prayer to Sanada, and headed  to the control room, where he sat down at the main control table. He wasn't a  crewmember by any means, but he'd watched, and he knew which buttons activated  what.

He pressed  one. Nothing happened.

He sat back  in his chair, rubbed his eyes and thought about his next move.

Then he  heard a spark, somewhere. Then another, and another.

There was a  brief moment of utter stillness. Then the rigs went active, sirens blared, and  the explosions started.

<p align="center">***</p>
It was just  the two of them now, along with the ship crew. The rest had fled. Sanada was  capable of commanding the ship, with Auduban's help, but they were running out  of money for the crew and would have to think of something soon.

While Sanada  slept, Auduban sneaked out of the living quarters and into the storage room.  They had all sorts of equipment in there, some of it acquired through illegal  means, and had been planning to sell it, but no station would let them dock.  The only option remaining was to fight space pirates and claim their bounties,  but the crew had absolutely refused, saying the ship had no chance in combat  unless it had some kind of ace up its sleeve.

In a quiet  moment, Sanada had recently said to him that she was running out of hope, and  on the verge of giving up.

Auduban  wasn't about to let that happen.

<p align="center">***</p>
This was the  end of the world. This was the fall and the shame, the final mistake, the  plunge into unforgivable darkness.

Auduban  cradled Sanada's head in his arms. Her torso was nowhere to be seen.

<p align="center">***</p>
His sect had  been removed from the religious order. Apparently they'd gotten too radical,  too extremist even for the Amarrians. Sanada didn't care; she said they'd take  to the stars again, preach the word. Some people were unhappy with this, but  for Auduban, there was no question: He would follow. He loved Sanada like he  had never loved anyone before. It was a love so pure it transcended language  and, almost, emotions as well: It burned so fiercely inside of him that it felt  like a tangible force, immune to thought and deed. Everything she said was  truth, and everything she did was right.

<p align="center">***</p>
With her  instructions echoing in his head, he began working the ship on a course to a  station. The vessel was a wreck, and Auduban doubted he could even make it past  customs with the box, and Sanada's head inside it, but he had to try.

The Fedos  crawled over him. Their emissions felt like perfume.

<p align="center">***</p>
He scratched the first one behind the  calciferous ridges on its back. The Fedo, excited, scrambled higher onto his  chest. He kept scratching, but his fingers slipped and poked through, into its  soft meat. It didn't seem to mind. He could swear that it was vibrating from  pleasure.

He felt as their mouths, with their tiny  rows of coarse, serrated cartilage, suckled at him, cleaning, looking for  nourishment.

The one he'd scratched was now at his right  nipple. He closed his eyes and sighed.

<p align="center">***</p>
Once he'd  inserted the flashlight, he put the lightgiver into a box. He'd rigged up a  remote for it.

He tested  it, clicking the remote.

Sanada's eyes  shone with light.
