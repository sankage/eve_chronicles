       "God; Emperor; Theology Council." Nusi tapped the triangle 
        he'd drawn on the board. "That's the theological underpinnings, at least, and - 
        luckily for you - this isn't a politics class, so that's all we cover." He 
        glanced up at the timepiece on the wall. "Well, that's it for<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>today's material, and we still have 
        time to spare. It wouldn't do to let you go early, so...any questions?"</p>
    <p>
       No, he reflected in the silence, it wouldn't do to be too 
        forward, would it? That would be gauche, under the circumstances. This group was 
        a fast-track class; unprompted enthusiasm would be unseemly. He moved forward a 
        little.</p>
    <p>
       "Annoli, you were looking thoughtful a few minutes ago. What 
        was troubling you?"</p>
    <p>
       "Well..." she started slowly, "is it true that the Khanid 
        aren't allowed in the Council chambers?"</p>
    <p>
       "Ah, I should've known it would involve his Highness. He's 
        too old for you, you know..." A few quiet chuckles rumbled around the room, and 
        then a hand shot up. "Yes, Garund?"</p>
    <p>
       "I've heard it's never stopped him in the past, sir." More 
        laughter.</p>
    <p>
       "Ok, ok, let's not be having fun at his Highness' expense." 
        Nusi shot a quick glance into the corner of the room. "Does anyone know the 
        answer to Annoli's question?"</p>
    <p>
       A more furtive hand went up. "Aleine?"</p>
    <p>
       "My pa tole me that it was the symbol that they dint like. He 
        said there was something about it that upset them."</p>
    <p>
       "Good, very good. Yes, the Khanid people, be they Imperial 
        citizens or Royal subjects, are allowed entrance, but the Royal Seal is...well, 
        it's not banned, per se, but it's not welcome there either. Now, does anyone 
        know why?"</p>
    <p>
       A deeper silence, filled with thoughtful faces.</p>
    <p>
       "Well, since we have time, I'll explain properly. We're going 
        to go on a journey through some symbols, because you can't really appreciate the 
        significance of the situation until you understand the background. First–"</p>
    <p>
       Nusi moved back to the board, wiped it clean, and drew a 
        circle with a small inverted triangle at the base.</p>
    <p>
       "What's this? Teilf?"</p>
    <p>
       "That's, uh...the first man?"</p>
    <p>
       "The first men, yes. Unbroken circle, God become man - looks 
        a bit like an upside-down egg, I always thought. That's probably symbolic of 
        something, too... Anyway. First men. This leads to–"</p>
    <p>
       A second symbol, one half-circle above the other, open sides 
        away from each other, with the same inverted triangle at the base of the upper 
        one.</p>
    <p>
       "Do you know this one as well, Teilf? No? Adi?"</p>
    <p>
       "Something to do with the dark?"</p>
    <p>
       "Exactly. This is after the Fall and so on, during the Long 
        Dark. Man and God entirely separate, with man below on his planets and God above 
        in the heavens. An age of savagery and barbarism and general unenlightenment - 
        an age which still persists to this day outside the confines of the Empire. And, 
        yes Annoli, outside the Kingdom as well. His Highness remains an enlightened man 
        in that respect. Which brings us to–"</p>
    <p>
       A more familiar symbol, the two semicircles laid one on top 
        of the other, with the upward-arcing one broken where the other crossed it.</p>
    <p>
       "This one you know; it's the Imperial Seal. When we came out 
        of the Dark and formalized the Imperial Creed, man and God were reunited 
        together again, albeit imperfectly. United but not conjoined, primacy of the 
        Divine and the rest. This is Citizenship 101 stuff, which I'm told you've all 
        passed now, yes? Good. Aleine, you have a question?"</p>
    <p>
       "Yeah, uh..what does this have to do with the Khanid?"</p>
    <p>
       "I'm getting to that! One final detail you need to know about 
        the Imperial Seal. You remember from earlier that the Theology Council asserts 
        that the rule of God comes before the rule of man? Well, the symbology at work 
        here is the underpinning of that concept. Just as the Emperor above rules over 
        the people below, so God above rules over man below. Primacy of the Divine isn't 
        sufficient: the implied heirarchy is critical to the rationale.</p>
    <p>
       "So then. When Khanid II upped and left, Heideran–" a glance 
        again into the corner of the room. "That is to say, of course, Emperor Heideran 
        VII, immediately declared him in breach of precedent, along with various other 
        things. The Theology Council, though, followed due process and sent a firmly 
        worded message to Khanid inviting him to explain his actions. There was a bit of 
        a delay, and then his Highess (as he is now) replied with this–"</p>
    <p>
       The same symbol again, but drawn upside-down.</p>
    <p>
       "The delivery was, in fact, a very nice rendering of the 
        Imperial Seal, done carefully in his House colors, but inverted."</p>
    <p>
       Nusi looked around. A lot of blank faces, but a few sparks of 
        dawning comprehension.</p>
    <p>
       "Rial, what property of this little sign is making your eyes 
        bulge in such a curious manner?"</p>
    <p>
       "If...well, if...if the Council gets its authority...the 
        thing on top... If the Imperial Seal is saying that God's law is better than 
        man's law, then..." The student glanced back over his shoulder.</p>
    <p>
       "Then the Royal Seal is saying that man's law is, shall we 
        say, more important than God's law. It's a historical discussion; nobody's 
        saying that it's true. But yes, that's what Khanid was trying to say – or at 
        least, that's how the Council interpreted it. With a single, simple image, he 
        denied the theological root of the Council's authority, telling them that he 
        could damn well do as he saw fit, so long as he broke no secular law – which he 
        hadn't, because Heirs are above such things. How, do you suppose, did the 
        Council react to this...Indlar?"</p>
    <p>
       "I guess maybe they weren't very happy?"</p>
    <p>
       "Hah! You're damn right they weren't happy! They passed down 
        judgement pretty promptly after that, and even though those Justices have all 
        since passed on, the Council as an institution still hasn't forgiven Khanid. 
        That's why it's extremely unwise to take the Royal Seal into the Council 
        chambers. They see it as a direct challenge to their authority, even now. Teilf, 
        you have a question?"</p>
    <p>
       "Didn't they, like, know about the symbol before? Like when 
        Khanid started using it or something?"</p>
    <p>
       "No, because Khanid's reply was the first time anybody had 
        seen it! It seems that he made it up just for this purpose, but decided to keep 
        it afterward as his Royal Seal. Only his Highness knows exactly why, but once he 
        made the decision, he stuck with it. There's other readings of it, too, and 
        again, nobody but Khanid knows which ones are intended and which aren't. For 
        example, given this – the inverted Imperial Seal or the Royal Seal or however 
        you want to think of it – you can arrive at this–"</p>
    <p>
       The second symbol, with the two separated semicircles, but 
        inverted.</p>
    <p>
       A glance again into the corner of the room. "This symbol is 
        frowned upon, but I'm allowed to explain it in this context so you know the 
        truth. I'm not going to ask you to speculate on its meaning; there are many ways 
        to interpret this, some of which you may come across over the years, but there's 
        only one correct interpretation, which is that the Imperial Creed is part of our 
        heritage and our culture and our very identity, but that our future is among the 
        stars. I stress again that Khanid II has never indicated that his Seal implies 
        anything more than rejection of the Council's authority, and that other readings 
        of the symbology here are simply incorrect. And that, I hope, answers the 
        original question in a reasonably comprehensive manner."</p>
    <p>
       A hand crept up lazily in the back corner of the room.</p>
    <p>
       "Zweir, you have something to ask?"</p>
    <p>
       "You've shown us five symbols. What about the sixth?"</p>
    <p>
       Nusi stared long and hard at the boy, and then answered with 
        a smile that contained no hint of mirth.</p>
    <p>
       "There is no sixth symbol, and that's all we have time for 
        today. Class dismissed."</p>
