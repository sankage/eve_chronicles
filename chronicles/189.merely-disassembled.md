# Merely Disassembled

<p>
        Parlan, reading scripture, felt a drop of sweat trickle down his 
        back. It was a late day in early summer and the fields outside still wavered 
        with heat. Through the window he could see the workers putting away their 
        microblade scythes and sending the last of the wheat through the binders. People 
        worked in shifts here on the colony, and it was Parlan's week for early days in 
        the field and late nights studying his faith.
    </p>
    <p>
        He wouldn't have minded being out there, working himself into 
        tiredness. It was far preferable to thinking so much, these days.
    </p>
    <p>
        He refocused on the text in front of him, willing his gaze to 
        remain fixed on it. Ordinarily, reading the scripture was akin to meditation. 
        The words would hum in his head, turning into a litany that took him elsewhere; 
        sometimes into the gentle rapture of faith, and sometimes merely into a void 
        empty of all sense, away from whatever earthly demands needed to be ignored.
      
    </p>
    <p>
        The drop of sweat kept trickling down, down, down.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sound emanating from somewhere in the room interrupted his 
        attempts at meditation, and he realized he had been quietly singing to himself. 
        He sighed, closed the text and got up, sliding his wooden old chair under his 
        wooden old desk, and massaging the sweat on his back into his robe. A look 
        outside the window confirmed that the day would still be warm but bearable, and 
        resplendant with nature.
    </p>
    <p>
        Parlan left his room, walking slowly through the halls of 
        quietude that formed the main section of the temple. He did not meet anyone on 
        the way. There were guests in the temple these days, travellers from other 
        systems who wanted to explore the Amarrian faith, but they would be working in 
        the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once he'd left the halls and entered the world of the living, it 
        took him a moment to get used to the brightness, the smells and sounds, the 
        slumbering freshness of it all. This temple, sitting as it did in the middle of 
        golden fields of extensive farmlands, felt like the head of a body: Quiet and 
        cold, silent and meditative, and ideally divorced from the messy vagaries of the 
        lesser orders of daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
        He walked at a slow pace with no particular destination in mind. 
        A keen eye was enough for nature to provide him with any number of distractions, 
        and for that he was thankful. He let the leaves on the trees fascinate him, 
        their veins showing through the remainder of the golden sunlight; and he 
        imagined what it would be like to soar like the birds above him, who barely 
        seemed to bat their wings. He looked to the hills in the distance, too; grey and 
        covered in their own smoky haze.
    </p>
    <p>
        That was another reality. He would be there tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        The winding paths eventually led him back towards the temple. On 
        his way there he walked past the conference area: A small, secluded spot where 
        acolytes could sit on wooden benches and discuss the tenets of their faith under 
        sunny skies. He came close enough that he could recognize the few people who 
        were sitting there, talking quietly. In this place it was held that thoughts on 
        faith should be shared.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not all thoughts could be shared. Parlan sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
        He found a tall tree, a sturdy tree with heavily foliated branches 
        and sat down in its shade. He was close enough to the conference area that he 
        could hear the soft murmurs of words. He shut his eyes and listened. Even at 
        this distance, where the words were unintelligible, he could recognize some of 
        the voices. He imagined that one of them was speaking to him. He realized that 
        listening for a precious voice was, in fact, a very religious activity, and he 
        grinned to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Someone right next to him - a woman's voice he didn't recognize 
        - asked if she could sit down. He opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
        She had blonde hair, beautiful in the fading sun, though it 
        stood in contrast with a subdued harshness of her expression. He expected that 
        the harshness had been there before she arrived. This place eased the minds of 
        its inhabitants, at least those who could leave their ill longings behind them.
      
    </p>
    <p>
        He realized she was waiting for an answer, so he nodded and 
        smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
        She explained, without too many words, that she was one of the 
        visitors - one of the 'rich' guests, she called herself, with a clear sense of 
        self-irony that he appreciated - and that she'd been working in the fields all 
        day, was tired and sweaty, had gotten sick of the drama among her own people - a 
        recent theft in the temple had started to fray their tempers - and wanted to 
        relax in the presence of someone who looked like they could use some rest 
        themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        She was forthright when tired, she warned him. He said he had 
        rather suspected that, and she laughed. He liked her already.
    </p>
    <p>
        They talked for a while about life on this planet and life 
        elsewhere. She was a mission agent, she told him, and had been working out of 
        her home planet in the Gallente Federation. He'd heard of the profession, 
        although it was rare for the colony to receive agents of any stripe. She asked if the 
        agents in the Amarr Empire didn't tend to have crises of faith with the work 
        they were doing, and he said that they did not, for the ones who aspired to the 
        profession were driven, rather than hampered, by their faith, and did not need 
        to buttress it. She said that she did not know whether she envied them, and he 
        admitted that he did not know, either.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the conversation he had stolen a few looks at the crowd 
        sitting by the conference area, still talking, and eventually his companion at 
        the tree - whose name, it turned out, was Heci - asked him if he had other 
        things than faith on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
        He closed his eyes and rubbed them.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Is it really that obvious?" he said, quietly, even though he 
        knew no one could hear him but this woman and God.
    </p>
    <p>
        "No," she said, to his relief. "But I have desires of my own to 
        deal with -not for you, darling," she added with a grin, patting him on the 
        shoulder and eliciting a snort of laughter from him, "- and they make me see 
        these things. You know how it is. When you look for signs of God, you see Him 
        everywhere. Same with other things."
    </p>
    <p>
        He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
        She fell silent, closed her own eyes and leaned her head back 
        against the tree. She did not ask him to elaborate, but he knew she would 
        listen.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was not sure whether he could discuss this, even though she 
        had caught him. He could admit to a sin in the abstract, but revealing details - 
        speaking them aloud - would make it real, and not merely an imagination inside 
        his own head.
    </p>
    <p>
        But he wanted to talk about this - he needed to - and he doubted 
        he would ever find a safer conversant for it. Besides, compounding it with the 
        sin of lying wouldn't enamor him with the holy.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I have never acted on it," he said, even quieter than before.
      
    </p>
    <p>
        "Never?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Well, look at me," he said amusedly, and held up the end of his 
        robe.
    </p>
    <p>
        She smiled and nodded. "Not much opportunity for romance, is 
        there," she said, not really asking.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Do you love anyone?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
        She looked away, to the vistas beyond. "Too many, really. 
        Including your kind of love."
    </p>
    <p>
        "My kind of love?" he said. He understood her, but he really 
        hadn't thought it had been that obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
        "The one that's not allowed? Oh yes. I know that one very well," 
        she said, nodding towards the acolytes by the conference and, he thought, in 
        particular towards the one he'd been looking at. She continued, "Even if most of 
        it was only physical - I hope I'm not making you uncomfortable with this..."
      
    </p>
    <p>
        "No, no," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heci said, "Unrequited love is a bitch. You give all you dare 
        and don't get the same back, even as you want to give so much more. You have to 
        continually accept that you are not the one setting the limits, but the other 
        person, who decides how much of you they are ready to take."
    </p>
    <p>
        She shifted, rubbed her back against the tree. "So even when it 
        was mostly physical, there was always some degree of love there. You just have 
        to accept it for what it is, and allow it to exist in your heart as long as it 
        cares to stay there."
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea that he would have to live with these feelings, 
        unrequited, for the rest of conscious time made Parlan intensely uncomfortable.
      
    </p>
    <p>
        "So how do you deal with heartbreak?" he asked, truly hoping 
        that her answer would imply some end to the way he felt, some course these 
        feelings would naturally take that would eventually lead them to extinction.
      
    </p>
    <p>
        And she did not. She said, "The heart is resilient and cannot be 
        broken, merely disassembled for a while."
    </p>
    <p>
        They sat there for a while, looking out at nature and God's 
        creations, and when the sun went down he left without a word. He kept the peace 
        and walked back to his room, where he sat and read scripture long into the night 
        until he couldn't stand it any longer, then took a shower so cold he gagged from 
        the shock, crawled trembling into bed, wrapped himself in the sheets and 
        shivered into sleep, the warmth rising slowly from within him.
    </p>

        ***
    </p>

    <p>
        The next morning it was his turn to visit the mines, as everyone 
        who worked on the settlement had to do from time to time. It was a long day's 
        walk and gave him time to think. Something about last night's conversation, in 
        that shade of the silent tree, had begun to comfort him even though the shock of 
        it had been too much for his tired head at the time. There was an inevitability 
        to his feelings that he had not realized before his talk with Heci.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mines, when he got to them, were the same pit of stink, ash, 
        smoke and misery as they always had been. The Amarr Empire kept slaves, and on 
        this planet some of those slaves tilled the fields alongside the acolytes, while 
        others, not yet ascended, lived and worked in this place. Some day they, or 
        their children or their own children, might be lifted up to the fields, but 
        until then they slaved under the eyes of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        Parlan was inured to their pain - the world was full of 
        suffering and it made no more sense even if one brooded on it - but he eased it 
        the best he could. For hours on end he walked among them, in their thousands, 
        bringing them water as they hacked at the earth. As he poured he sometimes 
        thought of the one he loved. Some of the slaves thanked him, others - too tired, 
        he reasoned - did not, but in every pair of eyes there was a quiet acceptance. 
        They did not resent his presence here, nor particularly welcome it: He was 
        merely here, and they were thankful for him while he stayed. This life they led 
        was their lot just as Parlan's was his, until the day God decided otherwise.
      
    </p>
    <p>
        He spent most of his day there. Some of the incoming slaves from 
        the fields, attending briefly on their own business, mentioned that there'd been 
        a commotion back at the settlement. He didn't care. His lot was to be here, and 
        give his love to these people.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end his robe was caked with dust, and he could not even 
        see his fingerprints for the clay that had covered his skin. When he finally 
        went back to the settlement he saw everyone outside, with serious faces, and 
        something starting in the open expanse of the conversation area.
    </p>
    <p>
        As he watched, one of the settlement slaves - an assistant to 
        the head minister, and someone he knew had family in the mines - was dragged out 
        there, stripped, and tied down. The minister announced that he had been guilty 
        of the recent theft.
    </p>
    <p>
        The slave overseer arrived, with his tools. It went on for a 
        while. Everyone watched, some looking upset, others - including Heci - horrified 
        and disgusted, and a few looking hungry for more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Parlan did not react, one way or another. The clay felt cool on 
        his dry skin.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a mindset where you achieve quiet and tranquility not 
        by accepting things the way they are, but accepting that they are the way they 
        are.
    </p>
    <p>
        When it was over he retired to his quarters, where he read 
        scripture until he fell asleep in his chair.
