# The Vitrauze Project

<p>It may not make sense at first. The complexities of 
life's story run so deep that it may take some time to understand. Some time 
indeed. Yet I tell you now that time will make the truth of these words shine 
ever brighter, because that is what I made them to do. </p>

<p>She was watching the people of Seyllin die on live 
holovision when they came for her. </p>
<p></p>
<i>
</i><p>Lianda. I must warn you, my child, no matter the risk. 
The Senate has learned of the appearance of new, stable wormholes, leading to 
unknown areas of space. You must not involve yourself in this matter. There will 
be a time and a place for your research to continue. Please, for the sake of 
everything you have worked for, lie low.</p>

<p></p>
<p>They told her CreoDron had only asked for one person. 
On the display, a darkened and burning orb glowed in brilliant shades of blue. 
Millions must have been there, she thought, trapped inside a dying planet. </p>
<p></p>
<p>They said this was the kind of help that would matter 
more tomorrow, when today had taken what it would from them all. Strangely 
poetic, the ones they had decided to send for her. Most likely no coincidence. 
They left her there. She would follow soon, once her affairs had been set in 
order. Those words, and the truth of them in her eyes when she stepped towards 
them so purposefully,</p>
<p></p>
<p>They had bought the privacy she would need to reach 
him. </p>

"CD-73, this is CD-Vitrauze, come in."

<p></p>
"CD-Vitrauze, this is CD-73, I have you."

<p></p>
"How are you doing out there?"

<p></p>
"Fine, just settling in."

<p></p>
<p>"Professor? What you said before? We're behind you all 
the way."</p>
<p></p>
<p>A poignant smile formed across her face, shared only 
with the on-board surveillance. </p>
<p></p>
"Thank you."

<p></p>
<p>The Helios stabilized as it pulled out of warp, 
settling for now into a cautious eighty-kilometer orbit. The gamble had paid 
off. Not that she had doubted her initial findings. She felt it was somehow 
appropriate that Vitrauze was where she found it. She had not signaled anything 
to them, not yet, not until she could see something. </p>
<p></p>
Something amazing.

<p></p>
<p>The system of Vitrauze, to most people, had been 
nothing more than another cruel and lonely place off the major spacelanes of the 
Federation. For most people, it would remain such. That was fine with her. The 
best secrets had always lain in plain sight, beneath casual glances that each 
day saw nothing. </p>
<p></p>
<p>She saw them, though. Stripping the unknown of its 
mystery had been her life's work, a task as noble as it was destructive. Before 
her now, just a few short moments away, was one more riddle, but it wasn't one 
she would solve to the end. She gazed out into the twisting shapes, admiring 
something she felt she had seen a thousand times before in her dreams and yet 
only now truly saw for the first time. It was as magnificent and terrifying as 
anything she could have hoped for. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For those there now, Vitrauze would be remembered as 
the system where they found that first link to the unknown. For her, it would be 
where she left something. She would burn, glow like Seyllin, and in that dim 
luminescence that her sacrifice shed, others would see the hidden paths to 
tread. He would have liked it phrased that way. </p>
<p></p>
<p>"Vitrauze, I've found something. Sensors onlined, in 
transit now. You have live priority feed."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The microwarpdrive engaged and eighty kilometers 
quickly became fifty, thirty, twenty and then, nothing. Zero point. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It had been named after an early Federation Senator, 
whose name in turn was supposedly taken from one of the first settlers to come 
through the EVE Gate. To the Amarr, "Vitra" meant simply "life." Life itself. 
The Gallentean understanding of the word was more subtle, however. To them it 
meant "living." </p>
<p></p>
<p>Different in the way sunrise and sunset are, she 
thought. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Six more Helioses decloaked as they dropped out of 
warp, falling into the same cautious long-range orbit as she had. </p>
<p></p>
"Whenever you're ready."

<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
"CD-73, this is CD-Vitrauze, come in."

<p></p>
<p>She stopped the thrusters for a moment, almost 
answering the call before deciding against it. They could wait. Even though her 
voice alone would mean so much, they could wait. For now, this moment was hers.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>"CD-73, this is CD-Vitrauze, come in. Problem at our 
end."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The blood immediately started pushing through her 
veins, accelerating with each new heartbeat. She fought back the instinct, 
millions of years and even more souls forfeited in the name of progress, all 
driving her to avoid this. To return. </p>
<p></p>
"CD-Vitrauze, this is CD-73, I have you."

<p></p>
<p>"Black Eagles have entered system, maximum time until 
location is scanned: approximately 2 minutes."</p>
<p></p>
"Proceed as planned. I am not here."

<p></p>
<p>Within just a few moments of those words reaching the 
other side, the flagship of CreoDron's private fleet deactivated cloaking 
devices and began about the crucial task of pretending to be useful. </p>
<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
<p>To most observers, "CD-1" would be considered a 
monstrosity. Horrifically warped Dominix hulls overflowing with esoteric 
electronics equipment often evoked familiar images, ones not so welcome in the 
heart of Federation space, particularly in recent years, and particularly when 
the vessel in question carried CreoDron tags. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To many of the leading scientists in CreoDron, though, 
it was their beloved "mothership." At times it would serve as their mobile 
research lab, as their home. Now it served as one incredibly risky decoy. 
Confiscation would mean an end to so many ongoing projects, but the weight of 
that also played in their favor. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The uncharacteristically dark hulls of four 
Megathron-class battleships suddenly appeared, sliding into the scene with a 
graceful menace that only the Black Eagles, with their specially commissioned 
ships, could project. Even before the violent tear in the fabric of space that 
dominated the area, gushing with its ominous crimson light, their presence was 
made known. The arrival alone would have its effect, but underneath it all, the 
official CreoDron line from that point on would remain steadfast. All contact 
with the other side had been lost. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Duvolle scientists had been "invited" to attend the 
ensuing investigation and it was they in particular who queried the absence of 
CreoDron's leading astrophysicist. No doubt their own interest in these matters 
was welcomed by the Eagles, just as Duvolle had welcomed the opportunity to see 
and hear things that would normally put their own operations under the 
Federation's ruthless self-scrutiny. These were the sorts of plays the Eagles 
were fast becoming known for, where saying no was made a twice-unattractive 
option. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The captain of the fleet understood better than most 
the capacities of his opponent. He would comply, but even though others made 
billions of ISK, these two outsiders now prying into their research would be 
considered by him and the rest of his crew as the very worst kind of vultures. 
This was how real, lasting damage was done. No press releases, no fanfare, no 
public comments one way or the other. Nothing would be made today but enemies.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As CD-1 was turned over indefinitely to Federal 
jurisdiction, the first discovery was made. In one ear, the pilots and crew of 
CreoDron were hearing stories of a new, unknown civilization and in the other, 
the mechanical drawl of a Federation police drone reading them their rights.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Normally, such a task was paid its respect, and even 
the most severe of the Eagle's captains would dutifully inform a fellow citizen 
of their legal rights. As both parties floated there, however – the once-honored 
formalities of the moment handled by automatons – the Eagles received their own 
distracting news. Another nineteen wormholes had been discovered, and although 
that amount by itself was easily matched, what disconcerted the captains most 
was that only five minutes before their arrival, the number had stood at one.
</p>
<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Helios rested up against the structure. The 
enclave in the distance seemed quiet, bereft of life. This one, however, felt 
young even now. There was such beauty in this timeless design, even though time 
had claimed them all. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It was more real this time. <i>He </i>looked more 
real, but she could see it. See that he was not, and that perhaps, this was not 
either. The data could have been pulled from the fluid router cache, enhanced 
somehow. Any automated system that could do something like this would be far 
more advanced than she had known, but then this was not her field, and she had a 
saying about scientists who casually dipped into her own. All the same, she 
could swear she knew the design. So old. She had these thoughts even as she 
stared at him. Too much a scientist and too little a soldier. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This time, there was no life in Hilen's eyes, and <i>
it</i><b> </b>was<b> </b>telling her to <i>go</i>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Once again into the darkness, and for a moment she 
could almost feel that wind on her face, as the data that represented who she 
was failed to cross the river back home. </p>
<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
<p>"We have reports of…78 now. 78, Corporal. I just had a 
scout land in… in…"</p>
<p></p>
"What is it, Captain?"

<p></p>
"…in Luminaire, Sir."

<p></p>
"What?"

<p></p>
<p>"An advance scout, deployed… deployed in Lonetrek. 
They reported the wormhole in Ibura, scouted the other side and landed in the 
middle of our operations base."</p>
<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lianda watched the leaves falling into the stream, 
plucked from the limbs of the trees with such ease. The wind was so gentle she 
could barely feel it on her face and yet it took them all, softly caressing the 
branches into donating the remnants of life they once bore. </p>
<p></p>
<p>She could understand that eagerness, how easy it was 
to let go after you'd grown out of the things that once nurtured you, that once 
comprised your entire world. </p>
<p></p>
<p>He understood this, of course. This was his VR 
channel, and he had chosen the environment for a reason. </p>
<p></p>
<p>"Hilen," she said quietly, looking across to the 
Deteis. His eyes were fixed on the currents that licked at the edge of the bank. 
A sobering gaze slowly lifted to meet hers. The weight of everything they had 
shared was staring her in the face. She fell silent. </p>
<p></p>
<p>"Go," he said, turning away from her and shaking his 
head. "Just…"</p>
<p></p>
<p>He disconnected the feed, leaving her alone in the 
surrounding black. </p>
<p></p>

<p>"Her unique network ID was accessed at the same time 
she attempted to make contact, yet she did not enter her password correctly."
</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Yes, we looked into it. She didn't gain any access to 
secure information. We're investigating the reasons she didn't authenticate 
properly." </p>
<p></p>
<p>"Of course, but that's not what I wanted to mention."
</p>
<p></p>
"Yes?"

<p></p>
"You don't seem to know what I'm talking about."

<p></p>
"Go on."

<p></p>
<p>"The password, the one she entered. The incorrect 
string?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I will put aside any questions I have about how you 
would have access to such a thing and ask you to come to the point."</p>
<p></p>
"It's a locus."

<p></p>
"I see."

<p></p>
"Yes."

<p></p>
"We were not aware."

<p></p>
<p>"With due respect, Sir, what you are not aware of is 
that for every one of those six Helioses inside your system, there are two of 
our Buzzards." </p>
<p></p>
<p>"I believe that as much as I believe you're a 
psychologist."</p>
