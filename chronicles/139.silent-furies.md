# Silent Furies

![Silent Furies](images/silent_furies.jpg)




<p>This configuration was new to him. A beautiful one, 
though it lacked the smooth subtlety of the Kaulas patterns, the ones from 
before the revolution. The Thukker as a whole had tended toward violent motifs 
after the great save, its people too drunk on their own rage to remember they 
were free, and every creation from its cultural womb since then had in some way 
borne fury's jagged stamp. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He set the object on the table. Before him was a wall, 
three quarters window, a tinted expanse of transnano stretching several meters 
to both sides and displaying the beginnings of a sunset upon the quarter beyond. 
Underneath the window was the small table, its contents cast in deep sun yellow, 
and at it he sat, his mood darkening with each passing minute.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He stood up, made his way to the desk in the opposite 
corner of the room and sat down at it. On the desk, a modcom was chirping.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Shakor," he said.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Emissary Shakor, this is Central," sounded the 
machine. "Your afternoon appointment just arrived at the compound. Are you ready 
to receive him?"</p>
<p>
</p>
"Is this Sergeant Ermika speaking?"

<p>
</p>
"Yes, sir."

<p>
</p>
"Your name isn't Central."

<p>
</p>
"Beg pardon, sir?"

<p>
</p>
"I said your name isn't Central."

<p>
</p>
<p>There was a brief pause, then a small nasal exhalation 
on the other end. "Thank you, sir. Forgot."</p>
<p>
</p>
"No harm done, Sergeant. Let him in."

<p>
</p>
"Yes, sir."

<p>
</p>
<p>Shakor leaned back. Resting his elbows on the chair's 
metal arms, he locked his fingers together across his stomach, tilted his head 
back against the top of the headrest and let out a long breath. He rubbed his 
eyebrows smooth with two hard strokes. Then he stood up, straightened the front 
of his shirt with his hands and walked back over to the window. He was standing 
there, pensive, when the door buzzer sounded.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Yes."

<p>
</p>
<p>Sound of someone entering, then a voice. "Admiral 
Morata is here to see you, sir."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Very well." Shakor turned half in the direction of 
the door and waited. There was a shuffling of footsteps, followed by brief 
silence.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Good afternoon, Your Honor," came a voice.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Hello, Hakram," replied Shakor warmly. "No need for 
formalities, least of all when they no longer apply." He cocked his head now in 
the other man's direction, as if sniffing something out with his mind's eye. "At 
ease, soldier," he said presently.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hakram Morata, Vice Admiral of the Republic Fleet, 
veteran of hundreds of battles, stiffened a bit, then relaxed. He shook his 
head, slowly. "How do you always know?"</p>
<p>
</p>
"Blind luck," said Shakor. "Have a seat."

<p>
</p>
<p>The two men made their way over to the small table and 
sat down at each end of it. A cool draft played through the sparse chamber as 
the door slid closed.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I'm assuming you've heard," said the Vice Admiral, 
removing his cap and straightening his carefully creased dark olive trousers. 
"About Yun." He studied Shakor.</p>
<p>
</p>
"I heard something," said Shakor.

<p>
</p>
"It's true."

<p>
</p>
"I have no doubt. Tonight, was it?"

<p>
</p>
<p>"Yes," said Hakram. "A little under three hours from 
now."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I see." Shakor cleared his throat. "How that boy has 
grown." </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He stood up and went to a carved wooden cabinet set 
into the wall, from which he gingerly retrieved a glass bottle filled with an 
opaque liquid of darkest brown. He unstoppered it. "Care for a drop?" he asked, 
somewhat perfunctorily, as he began to pour the liquid into two small glasses.</p>
<p>
</p>
Hakram smiled. "You know me."

<p>
</p>
<p>"That I do," said Shakor, handing him one of the 
glasses. A rich aroma filled their corner of the large chamber. "To ours."</p>
<p>
</p>
"To ours."

<p>
</p>
They drank. Shakor sat down again.

<p>
</p>
"So. What can I do for you today, Hakram?"

<p>
</p>
<p>There was a studied silence, and then Hakram spoke. 
"Well, sir, I want to ask you to consider some of the things Keitan is going to 
talk about tonight."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"A-ha." Shakor's brow creased. "Which things, in 
particular?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Well, he is going to cover a fair few subjects. For 
one, he's going to urge you to come back." Shakor sat very still and did not 
react.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hakram's eyes fixed on the spiked orb sitting upon the 
table. He picked it up. "You're really in a unique position to do the things 
that need doing, sir," he said, quietly.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I'm not in a position to do anything," replied 
Shakor. "I'm tired of the things that need doing. I've been a member of this 
carnival for too long. I'm tired of collateral damage and lives on my 
conscience. Tired of getting tangled in the political underbrush."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Tangled?" Hakram put the orb down. "But you dealt 
with the Elders, sir. You worked with the Thukkers. You circumvented every 
protocol there is."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Yes, at the cost of a good woman's political career 
and the stability of our government. Those aren't dues paid lightly."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"But you did what needed to be done," Hakram said. 
"You shook things up enough for them to be set right again. Why finish with the 
job half done? There is a groundswell of support for you, at the public level as 
well as within the entire structure of government."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shakor laughed. It was a deep and abrasive sound, the 
pounding of a punctured war drum. "Hakram. My boy. Do you think public support 
means anything, with things the way they are?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A tiny blink escaped one of Hakram's eyes, a momentary 
crack in his mask of equilibrium. He sat upright in his seat, glad, as so often 
before, that the old man was blind.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Not the public's, necessarily, but the ministers 
have…" he began.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"The ministers? That great thunderous gaggle of 
short-sighted polemicists? Oh, yes, I'm sure they love me. They'll love me until 
I do something that doesn't quite serve their interests, and then they'll hem 
and haw and harrumph and draft legislation and set their lackeys to screaming, 
and before you know it we're back to the low squabbling that keeps us stuck in 
the mud."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Abruptly he stopped there, and smoothed his eyebrows 
with a sharp upward motion of both hands. He stood up. Hakram waited, watching 
him intently.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I'm not the person for it," said Shakor. He walked 
back over to the cabinet, found the bottle and returned.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Sir…" said Hakram. Shakor quieted him with a gesture, 
then held out an open hand. He gave his glass to the old man.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I appreciate your making the trip all the way out 
here," Shakor said, in a more convivial tone. He poured them two more drinks. 
"Did you have any problems getting in?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I was questioned a fair bit," said Hakram. "Nothing 
too bad."</p>
<p>
</p>
"They know what they're doing."

<p>
</p>
"I have no doubt, sir."

<p>
</p>
<p>"If I'm not mistaken, there should be some domes 
perched on the horizon there." Shakor pointed in the direction of the window. 
"They're synthesizing plants from the homeworld over there."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Really?" said Hakram. He looked over Shakor's 
shoulder. Past the sprawl of squat metal buildings beyond the window he saw 
three gigantic skulls jutting out of the landscape, retiring rays of sun laying 
checkered patterns over their silvery pates.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Genesis vaults, they call them. They're aiming to 
eventually have specimens of every known plant from Old Mother." Shakor took a 
sip of his drink.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Impressive," said Hakram. "Very impressive. Wouldn't 
have expected it from the Thukkers, to be perfectly honest."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shakor set his drink on the table. "I wouldn't have 
expected it from anyone," he said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A period of silence passed between the two men, leaden 
with quiet consequence. Shakor was sitting with his elbows on his knees, flat 
palms pressed together, leaning forward. Hakram was sitting back, his hat in his 
lap and his left ankle resting on his right knee.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He switched legs, dusted a bit of lint off his calf 
and said "Maleatu… how can I get you to reconsider?"</p>
<p>
</p>
And so the afternoon went.

<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I have a message for you," said Hakram. He was 
standing by the window, looking out at the flat tops of the surrounding 
buildings, the tiny motes of windowlight like insect eyes in featureless faces.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shakor raised his eyebrows and lifted his head 
slightly in the younger man's direction. "Oh?" he said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hakram came back to his chair and seated himself. "You 
spoke of collateral damage earlier. About making sacrifices and never knowing 
whether they had any meaning."</p>
<p>
</p>
Shakor nodded.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Do you remember a decision of that sort that you 
made, twenty-six years ago, when you were fighting in Ammatar space?"</p>
<p>
</p>
Shakor remained quiet, his face impassive.

<p>
</p>
<p>"When the rest of the militia heads asked you to leave 
the front because your presence was bringing down too much heat on their heads?"</p>
<p>
</p>
Shakor gave a slow nod, barely perceptible.

<p>
</p>
<p>"When, despite their insistent cajoling and 
threatening, you stayed an extra two days in order to be able to gather crucial 
intel that would, it turned out, end up saving the lives of millions?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," said Shakor. "Very theatrical. You have my 
admiration. Get to the point."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"My message is from one of those commanders. Do you 
remember Silbraur Makusta?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Of course. He's a high-ranking member of the Justice 
Department."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Yes, but back then he led a group called the South 
Rixarn Army. It was one of the smaller militia groups active on the Derelik 
fringe back then."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Shakor's eyebrows lowered and his jaw clenched. "I 
remember the SRA," he said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Close-knit group, largely family. Highly specialized. 
Came from a…"</p>
<p>
</p>
"Hakram."

<p>
</p>
"What?"

<p>
</p>
"Just give me the message."

<p>
</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. Senior Counsel Makusta heard through a 
common acquaintance in Fleet brass that I was going to go to the Sanctuaries to 
try and convince you to come back. When he did, he had this message delivered to 
me and said that it was to be given to you verbatim."</p>
<p>
</p>
"I assume you've memorized it."

<p>
</p>
"You know me."

<p>
</p>
"Let's hear it."

<p>
</p>
"Well, sir," Hakram began, then hesitated.

<p>
</p>
"Let's <i>hear</i> it, Admiral," said Shakor.

<p>
</p>
<p>"He wants you to know that every single one of them 
would have willingly chosen their fate, had they known the stakes."</p>
<p>
</p>
There was a long pause.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Very well, Admiral," said Shakor. "Thank you for 
coming."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As the mantle of dusk continued its gentle slide over 
the moon's dry skin and its inhabitants began to lay themselves to rest, his 
modcom sounded again.</p>
<p>
</p>
"This is Shakor."

<p>
</p>
<p>"Emissary, Ambassador Keitan Yun has requested to 
speak with you."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He spun the orb in his hand for a few moments. How 
jagged it was.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Put him through."
