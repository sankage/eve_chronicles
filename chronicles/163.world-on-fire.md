# World on Fire

![World on Fire](images/worldonfire.jpg)
  

As he watched his crew slowly bring the end of the   world to light, Antar found it increasingly difficult to see this as anything   but the end of himself.
  

A long time ago he had realized that the full extent   of a life demanded the experience of both pleasure and pain; piety and   indulgence. He had explored the darker side with fervor and reveled in what he   found. With the Blood Raiders he had found not only the other, missing side of   his own self, but fellow souls who shared that same drive. Religion and hedonism   were finally combined in a cult to the individual that nonetheless presented   Antar with the strongest ties he had ever felt to any group of people. He had   found himself, home at last.
  

Part of those ties had been the mutual hunger for   more, which no one truly thought would ever be sated. It was a real but unstated   pleasure of anyone's life to have a mission that would not be completed; for if   they were to reach the end of the road, there would be nowhere else to go.
  

Antar walked through the ship, inspecting its metal   interiors. He stroked a hand over a cold wall. This dead thing was the end of   the Blood Raiders.
  

Once your dreams had come true, Antar reasoned, all   you wanted would be gone, and you would have nothing left to do but to die in   resigned silence. The mass harvesting would fulfill every possible demand the   Sani Sabik could possibly have for blood, and if they were to find their thirst   rising to even greater heights, the power of this superweapon, wielded   correctly, would establish Bleeding farms great enough to utterly quench it.   They were done.
  

Antar had not foreseen this end for himself. He had   expected to go out in fire.
  

So when a watchful crewmember reported a Thukker   vessel creeping in, and when he saw where the Thukker ship was headed - not for   their vessel but for the drones and the hive - he smiled, and then grinned so   wide he had to turn away.
  

And he told his people not to worry.
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

Most of New Eden would never know the horror of   Antar's deeds, or the bravery of the Thukker crew. They would only know the   cataclysm which followed, and the pain of millions as they suffered a fate that   would satiate even the most devoted Blood Raider's thirst for widespread   destruction.
  

There was no pain for Antar or Kotan. Existence for   the crewmen aboard both ships had ceased without their being aware of its   instantaneous termination, as the constituent particles of their physical selves   were torn apart and scattered into the void at velocities approaching the speed   of light.
  

It was just as well for them.
  

Of all the people touched by the event they had   triggered, theirs was the most humane fate. For neither captain knew that the   immense stock of isogen-5 which detonated before their eyes was entangled with   numerous stockpiles in even greater quantities, assembled for a very specific   purpose, and deliberately scattered throughout the New Eden cluster and beyond.
  

Nor could they know that the ancient race which had   placed them there possessed not only a vision beyond the grasp of today's   science, but also the technological advancement necessary to realize its   potential.
  

But all tools, no matter how simple or complex,   possess a duality of purpose. Fire can provide life-giving warmth, or can burn   the flesh from the bone.

"I'm sure this was covered during orientation," Dr.   Garcia stated, loud enough to draw the attention of other staff in the cramped   facility. "But Cassandra would tell you if there was a problem."
  

The young technician squirmed in his chair. As the   newest member of the team, he would have preferred to not be the one to announce   that the most advanced solar monitoring system of the Federation had just   inexplicably gone offline.
  

Yet the protocol for managing this kind of situation   was unwritten, and so pressing the equivalent of a "panic button" seemed a   reasonable course of action. Now every senior researcher in the facility was   standing shoulder to shoulder in the weather operations center, waiting   impatiently for an explanation they didn't expect to be worth their time.
  

The watch officer muttered a curse. "SCOPE just picked   up on it," he growled, shaking his head. "Must be a slow news day. Goddamn   eavesdroppers."
  

Dr. Garcia's glare was burning holes into the new   recruit. Everyone in the room figured he'd be bounced back to University within   the hour.
  

"Show us what you have."
  

The tech briefly explained his actions before   resorting to the playback. The telemetry had to be slowed down to frames just   fractions of a millisecond in length so everyone could see it.
  

Every sensor in Cassandra's advanced suite of solar   monitoring gear had spiked to impossible levels: subspace, gravimetric,   electromagnetic, and more, detected from the high polar orbit of the satellite's   pass over the Type-O star half an AU from where they were standing. The source   of this frantic energy release was a powerful explosion, roughly triangulated to   a source location between the planet and the sun itself.
  

Cassandra's last report was that the potent magnetic   field of the star had drastically realigned itself towards that explosion.
  

Dr. Garcia blinked. "Impossible," she mumbled. "Stars   can't do that..."
  

As if remembering something urgent, she glanced at her   watch. "How long ago did this happen?"
  

The technician checked his instruments before   answering.
  

"About three minutes ago."
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

It seemed like an unlikely place to build a thriving   metropolis.
  

Devoid of any atmosphere, Seyllin I was a hellish   world whose daytime surface temperature soared high enough to turn lead into   molten slag. Though deep within Federation space, the world and system may as   well been an unremarkable fringe territory hardly worth the fuel needed to reach   it. Sixty years ago, an independent surveyor named Braggs Seyllin left an   executive position with Material Acquisition to prospect on his own. Smitten   with the endless optimism of a true pioneer, he vowed to build a mining empire   that would rival the corporation which launched his career.
  

After numerous years and hardships which depleted the   entirety of his fortune, Braggs Seyllin finally struck gold—literally—with   TLXX-01, the Federation catalog name of the system which would later bear his   name. Deep beneath the surface of that cratered wasteland was a treasure trove   of natural resources, including an abundance of heavier metals coveted in   virtually every manufacturing sector of the cluster.
  

Undaunted by the steep logistical challenge of   harvesting this bounty, Seyllin raised the capital he needed from governments,   corporations, and private investors to build his vision of what a mining   operation should be: a frontier settlement, run by people operating equipment   rather than drones doing all the work on man's behalf. If it were any other   world or man, investors would have never accepted the idea. But the abundance of   subterranean treasure on TLXX-01 made the effort worthwhile—and Braggs Seyllin   was able to deliver not just on his promise to investors, but to the millions of   prospectors eventually lured by the opportunity to work and prosper.
  

Leave it to Federation terraforming expertise to   create a living, breathing world beneath the surface of an inhospitable planet.   In the mined excavation sites where thick veins of precious ore once lay,   intersecting caverns big enough to house capital ships were now illuminated in   gentle cycles with artificial sunlight; water ran in streams and falls   throughout a cityscape that was equal parts lush vegetation and stylish living   quarters; atmosphere scrubbers worked with the ecosystem to recycle air and push   a comfortable breeze throughout the miles of interconnecting city blocks and   work centers.
  

The ambitious subterranean project did as much for the   science of transforming worlds as it proved that the mining industry was core to   the identity of the nation. In all, four main cities would be constructed:   Loadcore, Metal City, Southern Cross, and Valimor. Braggs Seyllin died before   the last of these could be completed, but his legacy was already established. At   the time of his passing twenty years ago, 8 million people lived on TLXX-01. By   the time the planet was rechristened Seyllin I, more than a half billion called   those underground caverns home. These were thriving, pulsing cityscapes   interconnected by magrail systems that spanned around the entire planet. Peak   production for most of its natural resources was fast approaching, but the   economic and cultural significance of Seyllin to the Gallente Federation would   last long after the last chunk of ore was recovered.
  

Until now, this had been the expectation.
  

Access points for each of the main cities littered the   surface of Seyllin I. The most common of these were spaceports, which allowed   dropships to transfer passengers and cargo within the safety of shielded   containment fields. The planet hosted several space elevators for heavy freight,   but these could only be operated at night due to the extreme daytime   temperatures. Just beneath these access points was a network of operational   support structures, all filled with people like the researchers in the Cassandra   monitoring site, elevator freight cargo masters, dropship mechanics, and   thousands of others.
  

On the daytime side of Seyllin I, these individuals   witnessed a bright flash, then had perhaps a fraction of a second to notice an   alarming rise in temperature and hear the sizzling sound of air molecules blown   apart by subatomic particles. Those inside surface observatories, such as Dr.   Garcia and her colleagues, caught fire immediately and lived just long enough to   realize it before their hearts stopped beating.
  

Those at deeper depths were more shielded and thus   wouldn't immediately feel their bodies being penetrated and ruined by the   invisible onslaught. Instead, a curtain of dread would fall over them as the   electronic systems supporting their lives—including those which provided access   to the surface both here and on the night side of the planet—suddenly ceased.
  

Theirs would be the irony of being trapped in the   dark, when somewhere above them the hottest sun in the cosmos was hurling   radioactive fire upon them.

"This is no ordinary flare," the CONCORD   representative stated. "That much material bring thrown off is characteristic of   a supernova, only there isn't enough of it to suggest that a total collapse is   imminent. But the ejected plasma is following this new magnetic field at   incredible sublight speeds."
  

"So what you're saying is that we're going to lose   Seyllin…<i>completely</i>."
  

"As it exists today? Yes."
  

The President clasped a hand over his chin, rubbing   absently.
  

"How much time before…"
  

"Less than five hours. <i>If</i> everything else   remains the same."
  

Souro Foiritan stared ahead towards someplace far from   where he was. His eyes were glassy; there may have been just half a drop   quivering atop a tear duct. A few moments passed before he spoke again.
  

His voice, though, was strong.
  

"We keep this between us. Not one word about what's   going to happen, not even to rescue crews. We'll call them back in as soon as   you nail down zero hour. We can…save more people this way."
  

"If that's your decision, we respect it. But as you   know, SCOPE is a technically proficient organization which is quite adept at—"
  

"Take whatever discretions you need," Foiritan   growled, looking towards Mentas Blaque and holding his stare for a moment. The   Black Eagles commander gave an imperceptible nod before leaving the room without   saying a word.
  

"We'll do what we can from our end to keep them   quiet," the president said.
  

He paused again.
  

"If you were down there, would you want to know the   end of the world was coming?"
  

The image flickered, and shadows flashed each of the   men standing in the room. The CONCORD official never changed his expression.
  

"Mr. President, if I was on Seyllin right now, I would   think it had ended already."
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  <p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">  </p>
The dropship pilot pushed the throttle all the   forward. The cockpit began to rattle as the instrument panel erupted with red   warnings.
  

"We're too heavy!" the loadmaster shouted through the   intercom. "We gotta shed weight—"
  

"<i>Strap yourself in and shut up</i>," the pilot   snapped, willing his craft upwards. He could feel the seat beneath him tremble   as the craft's twin engines spewed white-hot plasma against the spaceport   landing pad. "She's got more than this, I know it..."
  

Three hundred survivors were crammed into the back,   nearly half a ton heavier than the maximum weight that the Federation   Pegasus-class dropship could handle for a planet with Seyllin's mass. The   military variant was equipped with enough thrust to put less than half as many   troops in full combat gear into a hot zone with 1.0 G conditions. Now it was   carrying a hold full of screaming victims from the pulse event at Seyllin, plus   all the life support systems needed to keep them alive. Most of the victims had   horrific burns, some with their clothing fused directly into the skin. This   batch had been transported by one of the few magrails still functioning on the   daylight side of the planet and pushed to the front of the evac queue. All of   them were violently sick, having been exposed to deadly levels of radiation   ejected from the system's blue sun.
  

The pilot could see dozens of dropships orbiting the   installation near this spaceport; his instruments were tracking even more than   he couldn't see. Local tower control was completely overwhelmed—most of the   pilots were either relying on broadcast telemetry from carriers overhead, or on   their own skill and vision to avoid collisions. All of them were jockeying   position to land, take on survivors, and get off as quickly as possible. And   though he hadn't seen it himself, he heard that the daytime side of Seyllin I   was unapproachable, limiting the number of sites where evacuations could happen   at all.
  

Audio warnings foretold of engine failure as the   Pegasus strained just a meter over the pad. His loadmaster was shouting a litany   of panicked obscenities that in different circumstances might have sounded   comical.
  

Keeping one eye on an external camera display, he   reached up and flipped two switches on a console; the mounted gun pods on the   dropship's nose and wingtips were jettisoned and fell to tarmac. The craft begin   climbing quickly as his instruments confirmed that the craft still maintained   structural integrity and would survive an ascent into space.
  

He was barely clear of the spaceport when another   dropship nestled into the pad, staying clear of the discarded bubble turrets.   Even though it was night, the surface of the sprawling spaceport was shimmering   in heat. From the IR vision in his helmet visor, it looked like the surface of   hell.
  

The Pegasus accelerated upwards. And as soon its hold   was cleared, it was going to return for more survivors.

"Every affected system had a Type-O star," the   scientist stated. "And it appears that every single one of them had an identical   event."
  

President Foiritan was beside himself. "'<i>Identical</i>'?   Where else is the loss of life so high—"
  

"Seyllin was the only world with a notable   population," the advisor muttered. "Blue-star systems tend to be devoid of   surface life, it's just too—"
  

"<i>Get to the point!</i>"
  

The scientist blushed. "The point is…it's not over   yet. This main sequence anomaly was just the beginning, but it….was set into   motion by something else, something connected to those subspace bursts. It   triggered a chain reaction that we're struggling to understand…it's as if the   fabric of time and space itself has been wrenched from beneath us."
  

The scientist's hands were trembling, but he had   earned the attention of everyone in the room.
  

"Alright," the president said, calmly. "Spell it out   for us, but quickly."
  

In a futile attempt to calm himself, the scientist   inhaled deeply before starting.
  

"Three other systems besides Seyllin reported   multi-frequency burst activity just prior to the solar event. All of it was   high-energy, electromagnetic radiation, the kind of energy released in massive   stellar events, but…each location is spread across the cluster, and…there are   probably more locations than we know about now…"
  

Prominent beads of sweat had formed below the memory   implants in the scientist's brow as the weight of the Federation's highest   authorities bore down on him.
  

"Go on…" the president said.
  

"We've detected multiple instances of point-defect   turbulence in systems unaffected by these main sequence anomalies."
  

"Wait," Foiritan interrupted. "'What's a   point-defect—"
  

"Wormholes," the scientist said. "The first naturally   occurring wormholes since the collapse of the EVE gate."
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  <p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">  </p>
"No matter how hard I try," Empress Jamyl said softly,   her clothes drenched with perspiration. "Death follows me everywhere I go."
  

Caretaker drones gently helped her sit upright in the   bed of her chambers. Servants no longer looked after her when she confronted her   demons. Lord Victor ended the practice not for concern of their safety, but to   keep her private affairs as far from the public eye as possible.
  

"We won't know the full extent of the damage for some   time," he said, taking a flask of water from the drone and handing it to her.   "You're sure the Sansha weren't a target of your adversary?"
  

"No more than Seyllin, or the Great Wildlands, or   anywhere else this catastrophe has stricken," she said, accepting the water and   downing it. "Yet even this is nothing compared with what is to come."
  

Victor raised an eyebrow. The Sansha were always a   prime surveillance and acquisition interest for Imperial intelligence. Their   advances in cybernetic technology provided the live realization for the kinds of   medical experiments that Amarrian scientists could only dream of. The Sansha   have long known that they were being watched, and that errant ships had been   captured and dissected by Victor's own men from time to time. He wondered if the   Empire would be blamed for the destruction of one of their worlds.
  

"They won't," Jamyl answered, hearing Victor's   thoughts as if they were her own. "They don't mourn their dead the way we do.   And besides…"
  

A drone extended an arm to help her stand. It was a   strange sight, seeing a woman this physically strong rely on a machine just to   stand on her feet. "…they'll be looking in the same direction as us for answers:   far, far away from New Eden."
  

Lord Victor watched as she moved away from the drone   on her own power, one burdened step at a time.
  

"I'm getting closer to understanding this," she said.   "I wish Marcus could see what the empyreans are about to discover. His work   would be vindicated."
  

"My lady, I don't understand…"
  

"You don't need to," she said, waving him away. "Just   thank your God that Amarr was spared from this."
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  <p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">  </p>
"You must do <i>exactly</i> as I say," the SCOPE   editor breathed, looking hurriedly over his shoulder. "Take this and publish it   as-is. Don't wait for confirmation from the others, just do it."
  

The press intern sounded unsure of himself. "Umm,   sure. Where, though—"
  

"<i>Listen to me</i>," the editor snapped, loud enough   to draw the attention of several fans as he pushed his way through the crowd.   The station promenade was packed for the regional skyball playoffs, but the mood   was more subdued than usual as word of the crisis unfolding in Seyllin spread.
  

The editor was under no delusions that he could escape   his pursuers by coming here. He hoped only to slow them down, and that this   intern could do what he asked before they got to him as well.
  

"Push this report directly into the international   feeds. Bump everything else off the queue, this takes flash priority. Do you   understand?"
  

"Flash priority? Sheesh, I don't have the clout to do   that—"
  

An unruly fan bumped shoulders with the editor,   spinning him halfway around. His heart stopped beating for a moment.
  

"You've been authenticated to send flash…"
  

He could see them: three men, in black coats. The   crowd was separating for them.
  

"Millions of people are counting on this. Send that   broadcast before it's too late for them…."
  

"Okay, umm, I'm in the system, and the flash with your   ID is queued. Confirm it?"
  

"<i>Ye—!</i>"
  

Thankfully, the explosion of pain in his lower back   was short lived, as the motor functions in everything from his neck down simply   froze. He saw himself collapse awkwardly—the impact probably did physical   damage, but he felt nothing. The attack had come from behind; <i>probably a   z-stick,</i> he thought, watching the Black Eagles reach out to confiscate his   earpiece and datapad.
  

He could tell they weren't being gentle with his   incapacitated carcass as they dragged him back through the promenade. They would   fabricate a charge against him, but couldn't hold him for long. Blaque and his   cronies would face a barrage of protests and legal threats for imprisoning SCOPE   reporters, and they were fully aware of it.
  

Which means the ends must justify the means.
  <i>  </i>

There is no question that Seyllin is doomed. And   people have a right to know that.
    

The editor hoped the message was delivered to the   world like he asked, and wondered why doing the right thing was always so   difficult.
  



<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

"We don't know where they lead," the scientist   continued. "Or, what we'll find once we're there."
  

For the first time since the crisis began, President   Foiritan began to face the cruel possibility that what was unfolding could   somehow be larger than what had happened at Seyllin.
  

"Warships can enter our sovereign space from them?"
  

"Yes. And though we can't predict where they'll   appear, we can say with reasonable confidence that their stability will be   affected by the mass that passes through them."
  

"Capital ships?"
  

"Possibly. But not an entire fleet."
  

"Not an entire fleet," the president repeated, pacing   back and forth. "But, say, a pack of cloaked Marauders, using a direct portal   between Luminaire and New Caldari—"
  

"Or between Luminaire and a system that's not even in   this cluster."
  

President Foiritan straightened his posture. His face   was gaunt, but he kept his demeanor rigid.
  

"Admiral Ranchel, how agile is your fleet deployment   along the Border Zone?"
  

The voice, carried by speakers in the office walls,   was loud enough to be heard in the hallway outside. "The strength of our   defenses won't be compromised so long as the frequency of wormhole appearances   is consistent. As far as location goes, if we can scan it, we can kill it. But   we would never pursue a retreating force, not without assurances of where our   assets will wind up."
  

"Very well. How many have we rescued from Seyllin?"
  

"Just over half a million."
  

Everyone in the room saw the color leave Souro's face.
  

"The limited number of landing sites makes it   difficult," Admiral Ranchel added, his voice subdued. "Given the amount of time   remaining, we might be able to double that figure. But not much more than that."
  

No one said a word. The president stood, surrounded by   his closest advisors, completely helpless to do anything more.
  

"Keep doing the best you can," he said. "Have you—"
  

The Chief of the Federation Intelligence Office spoke   abruptly.
  

"Mr. President," she gasped. "Mentas was too late."
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

"Wave off and turn back! Wave off or you're a dead   man!"
  

For the third time, the Pegasus was hovering just   meters over the landing pad. Its pilot could see people rushing the gantries,   trying to get into the spaceport's boarding area.
  

"We're out of time!" his carrier dispatch screamed.
  

His mind wandered as the craft hung in the balance   between life and death. Someone in that throng of people had surely given up his   place to let a wounded man onto the last dropship that would ever touch down on   Seyllin. Someone's act of kindness in the midst of a terrible nightmare would be   his noble end.
  

That person was right there, so close to where he was.
  <i>  </i>

"For God's sake, you're going to get left behind!"
    

Without his conscious approval, his hand pulled back   on the stick. The dropship was responsive, eager to fly to the carrier above,   and then away from the approaching wall of fire that would bring about the end   of the world. The hold was empty, save for a single loadmaster standing among   rows of empty seats covered with the blood and gore of those whom fortune or   kindness had spared. As though fleeing for its own life, the Pegasus turned its   back on the damned souls of Seyllin and hurled away, its lone pilot's eyes moist   with tears.
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  <p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">  </p>
The planet of Seyllin I perished, as did dozens of   other worlds—some in New Eden, and some that no person in recorded history would   ever know about. The intentions of Antar and Kotan were irrelevant now, as the   universe of their origin had changed so fundamentally that it would probably be   unrecognizable to them. Neither man could have imagined that the consequences of   their actions would be so widespread, or that evil could triumph so decidedly   over the powers of good.
  

The civilizations of New Eden would mourn for those   who were lost, and then search in earnest for the reason why they died. But they   would not look amongst the burnt cinders of shattered worlds.
  <span lang="EN-GB">  <p>They would search for answers by passing through tears   in the fabric of space, and venturing towards the unknown.
