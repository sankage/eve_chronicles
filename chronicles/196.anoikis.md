   <p>
        March 10th, YC 111. 
    </p>
   <p>
        Taking one last look at those unnatural shapes, the CreoDron 
        board of directors slowly removed their Egones and returned their attention to 
        the other figures huddled around the table. Everyone was waiting silently in the 
        darkness. Those with ocular implants bowed their heads slightly, and the strange 
        images faded from their mind.</p>
   <p>
        "We only have these six so far," a voice said from a speaker 
        in the middle of the table. "But what you are seeing says enough. There is an 
        18% probable match, just from this one alone."</p>
   <p>
        A reproduction of the last image suddenly dominated the far 
        corner as a large plasma-nanite panel came to life. The intense colors of the scene 
        overwhelmed the dim starlight that filtered in through one of the clear walls, 
        the pale blues of Carirgnottin I subdued by the glow of a deep crimson nebula on 
        the screen, teeming with the lives and deaths of a thousand stars. The backdrop 
        seemed to pulse beyond the silent and lifeless structures, drenching the entire 
        room in a strange sanguine hue.</p>
   <p>
        The clearest of the six, the image showed a ring of circular, 
        dome-like structures, which would later come to be known as Enclaves. Each 
        structure was connected by conduits that arched around to every other dome, 
        joining the separate discs together at perfectly smooth angles. Scale was difficult to determine, but 
        the entire complex was easily the size of a station. Though nobody would venture 
        a comment, there were some who even then guessed that it was a city they were 
        looking at. 
    </p>
   <p>
        A city of sorts. 
    </p>
   <p>
        As they stared in silence, each director's eyes eventually 
        came to settle on the imposing 
        dagger-like spires that jutted out from the ring, their angles sharp and yet 
        each edge beautifully smooth. There was no visible seam, no weak point in the 
        gently overlapping and undulating armor.
        Eight of these spires towered over the rest of the area, standing watch 
        like ancient protectors.</p>
   <p>
        "Not ten seconds after our drone was sent in to capture this 
        image, we lost the feed."</p>
   <p>
        "We need to send real people in," one of the directors 
        interjected, brushing the Egone before him aside in a less than subtle gesture 
        of dissatisfaction. 
    </p>
   <p>
        The last comment from the superior was meant to have been 
        dramatic. It was supposed to have humbled the subordinates into contemplative 
        silence and sent them fumbling at the sheer scope of what had already been 
        uncovered. The fast-moving minds of the men and women here shelved such concerns 
        for now, however, and quickly prioritized other matters entirely, robbing their 
        leader of his first contact moment. 
    </p>
   <p>
        In retrospect, the old man (as he indulged himself in being 
        called) would appreciate the quick-witted minds of his "subordinates" and their 
        own lists of concerns, particularly since this was, in fact, not the first time 
        New Eden had been here. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "Another hour spent deploying drones will mean someone else 
        beats us to the discovery," one of the directors offered, skirting the deeper 
        point entirely as they opted for pragmatism. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "And it could mean much worse than that," another director 
        added furtively, throwing some more ambiguous worry into the mix. The room was 
        still fixated on the ring of domes, and the dark, shadowy spires that rose above 
        them; the reminder was somewhat premature. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "Let's not waste time stirring people up with innuendo, Mr. 
        Darieux." The softness of a female voice commanded the attention of the 
        room, long before those gathered actually perceived the gross insult she had 
        dared to utter. 
    </p>
   <p>
        The woman who spoke was a Federation Senator – and a Jin-Mei 
        woman at that. This brashness was not her fault. She could only know assertion<i> </i>to be where she stood now, glimpsing 
        something before <i>her superior</i> was even 
        aware. She had long ago recognized that the fastest route to the truth was not 
        dissimilar to the flight path of a bullet, or the trajectory of superheated 
        coronal mass crashing into a planet: an inevitably straight line. 
    </p>
   <p>
        There was no other way to run something as vast as the empire 
        she helped steer, and so she followed up quickly with another lunge for the 
        truth, before anyone could muster their senses to speak. 
    </p>
   <p>
        Board room etiquette could go fuck itself. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "We all know who you intend to throw out there."</p>
   <p>
        A lasting silence hung about the room as the others lowered 
        their gazes, dreading to watch the exchange. 
    </p>
   <p>
        <i>No matter what happens 
        next, </i>they thought,
        <i>she's out of here.</i></p>
   <p>
        "Do you disagree with this course of action?" The voice from 
        the speaker asked, the stillness and calm in his voice like venom, slowly 
        paralyzing everyone in the room. He was making it
        <i>her</i> call now – a tactic she never 
        thought to expect. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "No." 
    </p>
   <p>
        "Very well," the voice replied. "Someone find Burreau."</p>
   <p>
        The directors raised their gazes and quickly arranged for the 
        extraction of one of their finest through a few simple gestures and nods. First, 
        all eyes turned toward the two Security Directors, whose bowed heads assured the 
        rest that Burreau's personal bodyguard had already been contacted and support 
        was inbound. From the way they almost smirked, it meant their people were close 
        enough to presume she was safe. A criss-cross of raised eyebrows thereafter 
        would confirm the temporary closure of key stargate logs, and a "clean" route 
        from her current location to HQ, as well as fleet support from a wing of 
        CreoDron's finest. 
    </p>
   <p>
        Black Ops fleets had been deployed, Sin Battleships were 
        already undocking and rapidly vanishing in flashes of blue light as they were 
        each deposited along a chain of cynosural fields stretching outward toward 
        Burreau – toward something each crew knew only as
        <i>the cargo</i>. Local CreoDron patrols 
        relocated to stargates, ready to intercept. Ishkurs and Ishtars deployed drones 
        preemptively in a gesture of threat, drifting at a distance from the passing 
        civilian traffic as their larger brothers circled above, invisible to all.
        
    </p>
   <p>
        Before the directors had exhaled for the second time, her 
        passage had been secured and escort arranged.
        <i>A valuable asset</i>, they understood.
        <i>Worth the cost of deployment</i>. Perhaps 
        that senator grasped this much as well; it would explain the behavior. Their 
        eyes never quite left her as she stood in the corner, arms folded, failing 
        entirely to understand their secret language of smiles and nods<i>. </i>
    </p>
   <p>
        <i>Maybe she's staying 
        after all, </i>they thought, looking among themselves.
        <i>Maybe the Jin-Mei came without permission. 
        </i>
    </p>
   <p>
        <i>Maybe it's personal.
        </i></p>
    <p align="center">
        ***</p>
   <p>
        "Sir?"</p>
   <p>
        Hilen was still there, staring at the ground where Lianda had 
        stood. For just one moment longer, he would allow his eyes to rest on the soft 
        marks in the grass, tracing over the trail of small footprints she had left for 
        him.</p>
   <p>
        <i>Cold Wind taught him to 
        move without sound or track, and to perceive the paths that are hidden.</i></p>
   <p>
        It was his job to follow her now.</p>
   <p>
        "That was One I just had here. Did you get a trace on the 
        call?"</p>
   <p>
        "Carirgnottin, sir. She's not moving either. We have her on 
        infrared at the moment, and she's still in place."</p>
   <p>
        " Two is still missing?"</p>
   <p>
        "Yes, sir."</p>
   <p>
        "Understood."</p>
   <p>
        "Sir, permission to speak freely?"</p>
   <p>
        "What is it, Arii?"</p>
   <p>
        "The security detail on her right now is like nothing we've 
        seen. The feet on the ground have multiplied by a factor of ten…my whole team is 
        on edge. The timing, sir. Seyllin."</p>
   <p>
        He hesitated for a long moment, wondering just how much of 
        the last conversation she needed to hear in order to do the job effectively. He 
        only knew it wouldn't have to be everything. Hilen Tukoss never shared a detail 
        people didn't need to know. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "With respect, sir, it's obvious. An entire planet was just 
        destroyed by some cosmic event and the astrophysicist we've been tracking for 
        months just disappeared. Vanished. Off the grid completely, without any of us 
        knowing where that second clone went. And now we're being told that her 
        surveillance status has been bumped to top priority?"</p>
   <p>
        "Let me bring you in then," he said, turning her own zeal 
        back around. "If you are ready to assume equal responsibility for our new 
        assignment?"</p>
   <p>
        "I'm ready," she 
        replied without hesitation. </p>
   <p>
        "CreoDron has just discovered a new solar system. They 
        arrived there through an unknown wormhole in Vitrauze. They believe the events in Seyllin created this wormhole, 
        and may have created others. So far, only scout drones have travelled to the 
        other side, but what they have found suggests that this system is home to 
        another civilization. Five images returned only planets, the last shows 
        something else entirely. They found structures, large ones, and I don't mean on 
        a planet."</p>
   <p>
        "How advanced are we talking?"</p>
   <p>
        "While scouting what appeared to be some kind of facility out 
        there, one of CreoDron's drones was shot down. The other five are still 
        positioned at the entrance to the system."</p>
   <p>
        "Sir, we need to get to Vitrauze."</p>
   <p>
        He considered for a moment the 82% probability that things 
        were not as they seemed. He couldn't dismiss it, but he distrusted the numbers. 
        Instinct was telling him that nothing ahead was all that
        <i>foreign, </i>that they needed diplomats, 
        not scientists. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "No," he replied, staring down at the information panel 
        overlaid on his wrist. Soon enough, a flood of intel would begin to pour in as a 
        hundred different sources all alerted him to the same event. "Check the news 
        feeds. One is about to hold a 
        briefing live on The Scope."</p>
   <p>
        "They're going to announce the findings?" Arii asked, turning 
        her attention toward a nearby screen as she searched for the face of her prey. She could see movement on the 
        infrared – she was sitting upright. <i>Like 
        she's about to say something important</i>, Arii thought. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "No," he repeated. "They're not, and there's no point chasing 
        them. They're about to contest the CONCORD travel advisory, and yes, soon after 
        they'll announce the wormhole. Six press releases later though, and they
        <i>might</i> start talking about scout 
        drones, maybe release an image or two, but they're sitting on this. They won't 
        release that sixth image."</p>
   <p>
        "Why?"</p>
   <p>
        " So the Vitrauze project can continue undisturbed. Why do 
        you think we lost Two? She's gone already."</p>
   <p>
        "If she's gone already, then why aren't we going as well?"</p>
   <p>
        " Because someone in the Senate was feeding her intel before 
        CreoDron even arrived. I doubt every senator has been made aware at this point. 
        There's too many; it would risk a leak."</p>
   <p>
        "Someone highly placed?"</p>
   <p>
        "Perhaps, but not necessarily. Someone who at least has an 
        overview of security. Someone with pull."</p>
   <p>
        "So you think the area has been locked down already?"</p>
   <p>
        "I'm not sure, but they only need to know what system to look 
        in, and then we would become very noticeable, very quickly. We've stumbled on to 
        something here, and right now, nobody knows it is the only advantage we have."</p>
   <p>
        "What's our plan then, sir?"</p>
   <p>
        "First we need to pass this up the chain of command."</p>
   <p>
        "Understood." 
    </p>
   <p>
        Somewhere far from Carirgnottin I, in an equally dark and 
        oppressive board room, another group of figures waited impatiently as one of 
        their own excused himself to take a call.</p>
    <p align="center">
        ***</p>
   <p>
        "Have you lost control of your asset, Hilen? Do you even know 
        where she is?"</p>
   <p>
        Hilen felt his wrist grow warm. Looking down at the 
        information overlay once more, he could see the first trickles that would soon 
        become the flood. A hundred of his best people all turning in the wrong 
        direction. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "We know where One is. If you're near a holovid screen--"</p>
   <p>
        The man raised his view to one of the panels filling the 
        lobby outside the board room. Just below a large platinum-thorium etching that 
        read "ZAINOU BIOTECH - BOARD OF DIRECTORS," there was the pale, innocent face of 
        the Jin-Mei he'd ordered his corporation's best surveillance to watch. The 
        voices back inside grew louder for a moment before being quickly overcome by the 
        growing sound of her own voice. They were all watching now. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "I see her. What is going on?"</p>
   <p>
        "They're escalating her profile. It's a distraction, sir, and 
        I need everyone there to ignore it. We have a situation unfolding in the 
        background."</p>
   <p>
        "I'm listening." 
    </p>
   <p>
        "Before I explain, I need you to get in touch with Ishukone. 
        Find someone as high up the ranks as we can get quickly and unofficially.
        We're going to need them for this."</p>
   <p>
        Hilen waited for an answer. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "I see," the director finally offered. "Tell me, Hilen?"</p>
   <p>
        "Yes, sir?"</p>
   <p>
        "Is it their previous experience that you're after?"</p>
   <p>
        And suddenly Hilen realized that he knew. He knew something, 
        at least. Enough to ask the question, and ask it in such an indirect way. There 
        was no telling what was infiltrated now. No line was secure. 
    </p>
   <p>
        "Yes, sir." Hilen felt a dull ache in the depth of his 
        stomach, the pain of the one soldier who returned back to base alive, having 
        seen the onslaught to come. 
    </p>
   <p>
        Except this time, nobody had fired a shot, and nobody would.
        
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        ***</p>
   <p>
        What do you intend, ambassador?</p>
   <p>
        I propose we call for a private summit of national leaders, 
        to discuss an exchange of information and come to an agreement about the best 
        use for <i>select recovered parts</i>. We 
        could use the Inner Assembly to arrange for the meetings quite easily under the 
        guise of an understandable concern for these events, which have touched our 
        worlds too, as we will inform them.</p>
   <p>
        The evidence?</p>
   <p>
        It will be systematically accumulated and re-integrated into 
        current technology in ways that render the salient points unrecognizable. The 
        finer details will have to evolve organically, but the framework will be a new, 
        non-binding agreement regarding scientific commodity trading. Although the 
        primary motivator will be the acquisition and development of new technologies, 
        there are also factors such as quarantine periods, comprehensive safety testing, 
        and many other additional barriers to access the empires can and will likely 
        impose without suggestion. The various research benefits inherent to each unit 
        guarantees widespread financial self-interest. Our engineers have already 
        produced a range of schematics. Some of them are new technologies, but we 
        believe the concession here is a smaller one in the long term. Where we could, 
        we focused on improvements upon pre-existing methods. 
    </p>
   <p>
        How do you suppose this will even work to suppress the 
        information?</p>
   <p>
        You must understand two things. The first is human 
        sensitivity. Seyllin is dominating the media, and as such, it is dominating the 
        public consciousness. This works to our advantage, but only for so long. The 
        world's attention is turned toward the disaster, so now is the most opportune 
        moment to make bold moves elsewhere. None 
        of them want to be the first to speak about the potential profits, the new 
        resources, the opportunities and secrets that can be uncovered. At this moment, 
        those avenues will be forced into the background, and yet undoubtedly pursued 
        all the same. If the empires are already operating on a covert footing, then we 
        need not lead them there. 
    </p>
   <p>
        You seem confident in this plan.
         </p>
   <p>
        I simply believe it will be an easy law to pass in this 
        moment. The non-binding nature will appear in line with the current lack of 
        information. A symbolic gesture made in the spirit of peace and cooperation, 
        made quietly and where few look, a means for all parties to ensure a more secure 
        future.   </p>
   <p>
        The capsuleers?</p>
   <p>
        Naturally, there will need to be a waiver on 
        capsuleer-related science and industry, but this is the second thing you must 
        understand. The truth will find its way out eventually. Please forgive me for 
        saying so, but I cannot properly serve in this role if I do not give you the 
        most accurate analyses I can. The truth will find its way out. We cannot control 
        their access. It will be they who make the discovery.
    </p>
   <p>
        How quickly do you expect this to happen?</p>
   <p>
        I cannot say. Their interests are unpredictable, but they are 
        divided and divisive. There will always be ones who question what most do not, 
        but I believe that overall, they will share the same goals as the empires. They 
        will take what they can understand and reintegrate. We may see another rise in 
        their power and autonomy as a result. We should expect them to monopolize on 
        this new opportunity as well. Given the inherent dangers of exploring Anoikis, 
        they are positioned favorably to do so. In 
        terms of raw resource gathering capabilities, conventional empire fleets will 
        not be economically competitive. <i>We</i> 
        will struggle to maintain a presence eventually.</p>
   <p>
        That will turn the empires
        <i>toward</i> research. 
    </p>
   <p>
        Not if we intervene and provide for them what convincingly 
        appears to be the most promising final applications of any potential studies. 
        This hints at precisely the point we must illuminate. When framed as a concern 
        for the balance of power between the empires and the capsuleers, our interests 
        will appear far more congruent with theirs, and our actions will remain 
        understandable. The empires can be made to quickly appreciate how little control 
        over these new areas they will have, and from there, it will be simple to assist 
        each of them in coordinating access to components we identify as key. They will 
        recognize it as the only opportunity any of them have for strategic equality. 
        None will refuse.  </p>

        Our 
        research?</p>
    <p>
        <i>&gt;Had she not 
        realized yet? </i>In the early 
        months, we can make a great deal of ground.</p>
    <p>
        
        Early months?</p>
    <p>
        <i>She had not. The

        the bloodstream as it tried to break free. </i></p>

        they will command it.</p>
    <p>
        They 
        will not be everywhere at once, and we can move undetected.</p>
    <p>
        In 
        this environment, so can they. We are all headed to the same destinations. We 
        have no desire to be noticed, and no hope in conflict with them.</p>
    <p>
        Then 
        we will use these early months well.

        <i>She recovered 
        quickly from that thought, he mused. </i>
       Yes.</p>
    <p>
        If the situation is ever understood in its entirety, as you 
        predict, then there will be consequences for these actions. 
    </p>
   <p>
        I do not share that view. What we do now benefits all 
        parties. If our motives are ultimately viewed as benign, then any perceived 
        wrongdoings can be explained in full detail as they are identified. Trust and 
        clarification at the highest tiers will filter downward and provide the level of 
        institutional compliance necessary to establish the agreement.

        You must still realize that we cannot become publicly 
        involved in this? 
    </p>
   <p>
        Yes, this is obvious to me. The suggestion will be put 
        forward earlier, between myself and the other ambassadors, or the national 
        leadership, if you please.</p>

        "I believe she is dead."</p>
   <p>
        "You are correct. There was activity on the line. She was at 
        one of the mirrors." </p>
   <p>
        <i>The ambassador almost 
        seemed to smile for a moment.</i> "She learned well."</p>
   <p>
        "She was taught by the best. We are concerned about the 
        reasons why she was chosen. "</p>

        Article 8, Section E</p>
   <p>
        CONCORD subsidization in the acquisition of scientifically 
        valuable by-products. 
    </p>
   <p>
        Although preliminary, through the spirit of peace and 
        co-operation that affirms this treaty, each of the four member nations have 
        exchanged sufficient information to identify four key salvageable materials of 
        scientific interest. Seeking to both minimize their impact on capsuleer economic 
        development and to allow more time for proper investigation into the impact of 
        all unknown materials, the member nations have agreed to focus on four lower 
        tier by-products identified during initial excavations of unknown space.</p>
   <p>
        Clause 1) The four member nations of the treaty have each agreed that the 
        preliminary findings, and any agreements based thereupon, on each of the four 
        units is strictly provisional. Current scientific opinion broadly agrees that 
        these items are of little material value. However, any reassessment undertaken 
        by any of the member nations that is deemed to invalidate this initial finding 
        may be deferred to. </p>
   <p>
        Clause 2) CONCORD, in operation with the SCC, has agreed to facilitate 
        and subsidize the acquisition of these items through capsuleer markets at a 
        standard price agreed upon by all of the four member nations.
