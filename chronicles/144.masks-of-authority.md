</p>
<p>Since the early days of the Caldari State, the eight 
corporate police forces of the Chief Executive Panel have played an important 
role in Caldari society. Figures of great public attention, reviled and 
worshiped in equal measure (often by the same person), these eight private 
militaries collectively match the official Caldari Army in numbers and far 
exceed it in training.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What are these forces, how do they operate, and how 
did they come to be? </p>
<p>
<b>
</b></p>
Necessity and Invention


<p>
</p>
<p>Some years after the dust of the Caldari-Gallente War 
had settled and the eight corporations of the Chief Executive Panel were getting 
acclimated to running an independent Caldari State, the issue of defense 
spending was raised at a national budget meeting. The Kaalakiota Corporation and 
the Sukuuvestaa Corporation were by this point well established as bitter 
competitors for the top of the revenue pile, and the subject spawned a heated 
debate between the two corporations' CEOs. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The passage of time had done little to diminish the 
Kaalakiota leadership's wartime alertness; they had long been advocates of 
increased military spending, particularly towards protection of assets in the 
homeland. The Sukuuvestaa, meanwhile, wanted the available funds diverted 
towards land partitioning on newly settled planets, reasoning that the creation 
of new assets was every bit as important as the protection of existing ones. 
That Kaalakiota dealt primarily in arms at the time, and Sukuuvestaa primarily 
in real estate, were topics not raised at the meeting.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Due to the rivalry between the two the discussion soon 
escalated far beyond its purview, and what began as a simple debate swiftly 
turned into a heated argument rife with overtones of power struggle. The 
remaining executives of the CEP, uncomfortable with this potential disruption in 
the works, voted to momentarily shelve the topic.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Kaalakiota was not happy. Shortly after the meeting, 
they announced that the corporation would be bringing its own financial 
resources to bear in forming an independent internal security force, "tasked 
with maintaining peace and order on all Kaalakiota holdings." This organization 
they called Home Guard, a name taken by the corporate-political community as a 
pointed reference to the dispute between the two leaders. Sukuuvestaa responded 
in kind by releasing a statement curtly announcing their intention to create 
their own military arm. In a direct jab at Kaalakiota, they named their force 
the "Peace and Order Unit." The other mega-corporations, not to be outdone, soon 
followed suit. Within the year, all eight members of the Chief Executive Panel 
had either announced or begun formation of their own internal security forces.</p>
<p>

Smoke and Mirrors


<p>
</p>
<p>From this bed of bluster sprouted the eight 
organizations known today as the Chief Executive Panel's faces of power. Equal 
parts propaganda tool and police force, the corporate forces are in many ways 
the most direct outward representation of their parent corporations' power, 
affluence, style and cultural significance. Seeking to capitalize on the 
relentless propaganda battle between the powers that be, Caldari entertainment 
interests have in recent years made very lucrative deals with these forces, 
hurling their desired images into the cultural zeitgeist in return for a slice 
of the profit pie.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Avoiding direct competition in favor of finding their 
own niche, each of the eight has diversified into their own particular area. 
Spacelane Patrol, CBD's corporate force, is continually portrayed as a cadre of 
brash hotshots who travel from one corner of the universe to another on missions 
that usually involve much purposeful strutting around exotic locales. The Lai 
Dai Protection Service, meanwhile, are regularly shown to be a group of 
dashingly handsome tactical geniuses who devise complex original stratagems at 
the drop of a hat, usually under circumstances of extreme duress. Kaalakiota 
were the first to make this type of entertainment deal and have arguably been 
the most successful: Home Guard's image is second to none, not just among the 
corporate corps establishment but also in the popular cultures of all four 
empires. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The glossy tropes of the public relations holoreels 
and the beige glamour of stylized war worship stand in stark contrast to the 
reality of these agencies, but most people have only a muddy awareness of the 
dichotomy. A man can be rudely treated by a brusque and superior Ishukone Watch 
officer and silently curse him for hours, but as soon as he gets home that 
evening he is just as likely to prop his feet up and enjoy a rousing serial 
where the Ishukone Watch's superior technology and cunning allows it to root out 
Gurista spies and double-cross them into revealing their hideout. So pervasive 
is the propaganda that it is highly doubtful this man ever draws a parallel 
between the real thing and the image; the connection he draws, instead, is 
between the image and the mother corporation it represents.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Internal Security, the Nugoeihuvi Corporation's force, 
poses a curious irony in this regard. Though the Nugoeihuvi conglomerate's main 
preoccupation is the entertainment industry, they have consistently failed to 
change the prevalent cultural image of their troops as a pack of 
rough-and-tumble thugs culled from the Caldari underworld, given to the grossest 
abuses and atrocities. It's very rare for elements of the Caldari State to find 
the rumor mill outgrinding them in their efforts at propaganda, but that's 
what's happening to Nugoeihuvi. (In reality, for the record, Nugoeihuvi's 
soldiers are not any more or less savage than those of the other corporate 
forces, though broadly speaking they have been noted to harbor a slightly 
greater proclivity toward drink and drugs.)</p>
<p>
<b>
</b></p>
Cloak and Dagger


<p>
</p>
<p>Of course, the strong public relations utility of 
these forces does not mean that the good men and women that serve within them 
are mere puppets on a stage (though there exists, of course, a contingent of 
people willing to proclaim just that). It is an integral thing, for obvious 
practical reasons, that these militaries be proven without the shadow of a doubt 
to have aptitude in their profession. For this purpose a training summit is held 
each year at an undisclosed location, where the corporate forces lock horns in a 
series of combat- and survival-related challenges. This is the Haadoken Summit, 
and it is an event of great significance in Caldari culture.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Since nominally none of the corporations want the 
results to get out, the proceedings carry a veneer of secrecy. Betting on the 
event is strictly illegal, but it nonetheless creates underground gambling 
revenue far exceeding that of any official State sporting or entertainment 
event. Despite ledger upon ledger of regulations and reprimands, information 
about the results is invariably leaked by someone in the winner's camp, and so 
it is in this crucible of competition that the holoreels, the slogans, the 
commercials and the claims are either gloriously validated or revealed as 
nothing but empty spectacle. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Though nobody is ever declared deceased during the 
proceedings, it is a matter of public record that at least a dozen die each year 
and many more are injured (the families of the fallen receive standardized 
letters of condolence claiming their loved one has died in a training accident). 
Being essentially a contest between corporate ideologies played out in a 
quasi-military arena, the event touches many nerves in the Caldari soul, and its 
various obstacles and scenarios have been immortalized in countless holoreels 
and serials. The winners of the last three Haadoken summits have been the 
Ishukone Watch, whose level of training and tactical skill appears to be 
currently unmatched within the corporate forces.</p>

Bread and Butter


<p>
</p>
<p>These agencies also perform the more mundane duties of 
a mega-corporation's internal security force. They ceaselessly patrol the 
perimeters of their territories; they conduct counterstrikes against pirates and 
terrorists; and they are responsible for security on every ship, outpost, 
station, moon and planetside facility owned by their mother corporations. They 
are also granted legal authority to act as police proxies within corporate 
jurisdiction, though in all cases where regional police have a presence their 
authority supersedes that of the corporate police. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Corporate forces are often criticized for their 
policework. Some of the more common accusations are gruff and uncaring demeanor, 
propensity for unnecessary violence, and lack of response time (particularly to 
non-acute, non-violent crimes). There is a simple reason for this: among the 
corporate forces, policework – which invariably involves dealing with the great 
unwashed masses – is seen as a lower-rung duty, a job for those unfit to serve 
in more of a military capacity. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Worst of all is policework on space stations, which 
tend to be overcrowded with travellers from a staggering multitude of places, 
each possessing a different set of legal rights based on his nationality and 
organizational affiliation, and each of which is cranky and in a rush and 
probably sweating. Additionally, corporate interstellar law dictates that 
stations' rental offices and other commercial zones be segmented into a 
patchwork of diplomatic units, each with its own rules and regulations. 
Policework on stations therefore tends to be an affair fraught with 
jurisdictional pratfalls and covered in a tangled underbrush of red tape.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To their credit, corporate forces do have a 
well-deserved reputation for responding swiftly and decisively when 
circumstances truly call for it. If things get very bad very fast – if there is 
a hostage situation, if there is a large brawl, if there is some sort of 
large-scale accident or disaster – the corps will be there, fast, and they'll 
attack the problem with everything they've got. People may grumble about 
rudeness and laziness and bureaucracy, but regardless they rest content in the 
knowledge that if a true crisis presents itself, they're in good hands.</p>
<p>

Steel and Plasma


<p>
</p>
<p>Altercations between the corporate forces exist on 
record, but in almost every case they have been small incidents based on 
misunderstanding, with warning shots the only ordnance released. A notable 
exception is an incident known as the Ingalles incident, where soldiers 
belonging to the Wiyrkomi Peace Corps opened fire on a Hyasyoda convoy being 
escorted by the Hyasyoda's agency, the Corporate Police Force.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Hyasyoda detail had received advance clearance for 
entry into the outpost, a high-tier classified Wiyrkomi research node buried in 
the shadow of a Citadel moon. They were to escort the CEO of a subsidiary of 
Hyasyoda's, Santra Alloys, to a meeting with a high-ranking Wiyrkomi scientist. 
The arrangement was legitimate (if unusual), but the Wiyrkomi Peace Corps saw 
incongruity in the direct meeting of a CEO and a scientist. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They stopped the convoy and conducted a heavy-handed 
interrogation. Due to a fatal combination of bad intel and jittery nerves, they 
then ended up attacking it, killing four people and destroying the reputation of 
their police force for years to come. (To this day, the Wiyrkomi Peace Corps are 
something of a laughing stock among the corporate forces, and to compound things 
they consistently place near the bottom of the yearly summit's scoreboards.)</p>
<p>

Today and Tomorrow


<p>
</p>
<p>It is unclear at this moment whether Tibus Heth, the 
Caldari State's newly instated Executor, has any specific plans for the 
corporate forces. It is considered likely, however, that he will try to gain 
control of them and use them for his ends if hostilities with the Gallente 
Federation escalate any further. Doing so will be easier said than done, as 
these organizations retain a great deal of power in the name of their public 
appeal, to say nothing of their competent and well-equipped soldiery. The 
allegiances of the complex network of sponsors, affiliates and marketers they 
associate with, however, are wholly unknown.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During the invasion of Caldari Prime, all eight forces 
lent manpower to various aspects of the operation, from tactical strikes to 
civilian relocation, and the squadrons who participated have now mostly come 
back. Some scarred by atrocity, others whetted and ready for more, they are 
returning to their compatriots bearing tales of woe and grandeur on the blasted 
front. Where their loyalties will fall – and what sort of influence they'll 
spread – is anybody's guess.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If and when the time comes for Heth to begin making 
inroads, it remains to be seen what the CEOs of the Chief Executive Panel will 
do to hold on to these flagbearers of their outward image. One thing is certain, 
at any rate: whoever commands these forces controls a good deal more than just a 
group of men with guns. </p>
