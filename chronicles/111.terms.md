<i>
</i><p>We have an offer for you. Wealth, comfort, anonymity 
and safety. No more running, no more worries of whether this organization to 
which you belong will destroy you. A new life.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Vania leaned back in her chair and rubbed her eyes. 
She'd been feeling cranky and feverish all day, and this really wasn't helping.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The message had come from "Jocasta Meliaan", whom the 
message identifiers verified as being a low-ranking member of Kaalakiota. It was 
possible to do a search through KK's database - they kept their employment 
records open to the general public - but Vania already knew she would find no 
one there by that name. Jocasta didn't exist. She was a facade for the Caldari 
State forces.</p>
<p>
<i>
</i></p>
<p>We know you're close to the leader. This is a 
terrorist organization you're involved with, and while they're ostensibly 
improving worker conditions, they are in fact working against the Caldari State. 
All you will ever accomplish with this group is more bloodshed and more 
violence. The recent freighter loss alone killed tens of thousands.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>All we ask is that you help an agent of ours get close 
to your leader. We will get the person into your organization andyou will take 
over from there. No one but you will ever know who this agent is; no one will 
ever link you to the agent's presence.</p>

<p>
<i>
</i></p>
<p>This is the best way to defuse the situation without 
undue harm, and the only way that you and your companions will make it through 
alive.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Vania shook her head and deleted the message. She 
couldn't for the life of her imagine what would make these people think she 
could be swayed their way. Yes, she'd attached herself to Melarius, and yes, if 
she looked deep inside, she'd probably find the motivation to be 
self-preservation rather than morality or love. The factory floors had held 
little future, certainly. But neither did turncoating.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She got up, put on some warmer clothes and headed out 
into the hallways. They were traveling on a small industrial ship, modified to 
accommodate various pieces of stealth and communications equipment, and 
outfitted with excellent medical facilities in case of combat casualties. There 
was enough space for just over a thousand people, though their rations would 
keep at most a few hundred going.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Vania headed for the ops room. The metal walkways 
echoed under her footsteps, and the iron handrails were cold to the touch. There 
was always a chill in the air, and too much dust and metal filings in the 
corners. The medical facilities were well stocked, but with these kinds of 
living arrangements, and in such an enclosed space, colds and illness remained 
an endless source of frustration.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Most of the people she passed on her way there were 
other ex-factory workers, though there were some that had a distinct air of 
bureaucracy around them. She found herself wondering which ones were potential 
traitors, but closed off that line of thought. Paranoia wouldn't do her any 
good.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In the ops room, Melarius was crouched over tactical 
maps, discussing engagement tactics with Genharis Yuvoka. The latter was 
Melarius's right-hand man and a former Kaalakiota employee who had forsaken his 
masters for loyalty to a higher ideal.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Both men stopped talking when Vania entered. She 
walked directly to Melarius - one of few who could do such a thing, since he was 
flanked by a dozen armed guards at all times - planted a kiss on his cheek and 
asked how things were going.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Not too good," Melarius said. There were dark patches 
under his eyes, and his voice had the choked throatiness of someone who'd 
inhaled too much cold, infected air. Vania knew how he felt.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I heard we were getting more and more support," she 
said. "Especially after that freighter was blown up."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"We are," he said. "I'd be surprised if we don't pull 
in at least a few thousand heads. Amazing how death affects the minds of the 
living."</p>
<p>
</p>
"So what's next?" Vania asked.

<p>
</p>
<p>"That's our business," Genharis said. She glared at 
him, and he returned the stare.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Rallying support," Melarius said. "That's all we're 
doing now. We've got most of our equipment in place, and what we need is 
manpower, committed manpower. That includes both of you, by the way. The last 
thing I need are ego fights in ops."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"She shouldn't even be here at all," Genharis 
muttered.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Then why don't you <i>make</i> me go, big boy?" Vania 
said. "I've seen used tampons with more backbone than you."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Right, thanks, enough," Melarius said. "Genharis, 
cool it. We're not going over this again. She's here, and she stays."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Vania gave Genharis the finger, but Melarius turned to 
her. "And you. Can you keep it under wraps for now, please? I'm letting you stay 
here because I gave up on arguing against it, but if you can't let us work you 
have no place in this room. It's hard enough planning a revolution without 
having a loose cannon firing off at everyone around me."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Sir," Vania said and gave him a mock salute, then 
leaned in and gave him a kiss, appearing completely unperturbed. "Anyway, I'll 
head off, let you big boys deal with the big issues. But if you get blown up 
too, don't come crying to me."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She left the ops room and started slowly walking back 
towards her quarters, but a moment later she heard rapid footsteps approaching. 
She turned and saw Genharis walking up to her.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"You witch. You harpy," he said, sputtering in anger. 
"Do you have any idea what we're dealing with? Do you think you can just waltz 
in there, spread your poison and walk right back out?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She began to reply, but he grabbed the neckline of her 
shirt and held taut, shaking her with his fury. "Melarius hasn't slept in gods 
know how long, and he's consumed with anger and sorrow over the freighter 
incident. The last thing he needs is comments from someone who has no 
responsibility, no rights to be here and no one to answer to."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Vania smiled, and stuck her hands in her pockets. "And 
this is going to help him how?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Genharis subsided a little at that. "All right," he 
said, letting go of her shirt. "Okay. I know, it's-"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He got no further, as Vania pulled a small knife out 
of her pocket, grabbed hold of Genharis and with surprising force slammed him 
against the nearest metal wall. Before he could break her grip she had moved 
right up against him, the point of her knife resting against his stomach, the 
forearm of her other hand resting on his throat. The people who walked past, 
survivors of years at the Caldari factories and industrial plants, pointedly 
ignored them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"It's really quite simple, Genharis," she hissed at 
him. "You know nothing, absolutely nothing about what I've gone through to get 
here. You have no idea what it took for me even to get a job at the factory, or 
what I was forced to do before then. So don't you <i>dare</i> think you can get 
high and mighty with me. This is where I am, and this is where I'm staying, and 
if you get in my way I will <i>kill</i> you."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She removed her arm from his throat, but held the 
knife in place.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"You can only think of yourself, can't you?" Genharis 
said quietly.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Nobody else will," she said, backing off and putting 
the knife back in her pocket. For a moment she was hit with a strong sense of 
nausea and vertigo, but she fought it off, and Genharis didn't seem to have 
noticed. She glared at him and stalked off.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It wasn't too long after that Vania went in for her 
regularly scheduled body scan. When they'd gotten this ship, and when the 
Brotherhood had started growing in numbers, ops had decided that everyone should 
go in for regular checks. People's health was bad enough as it was without the 
risk of adding some new and disgusting infectious disease to the mix. Vania 
herself had been feeling increasingly worse; the onsets of vertigo and nausea 
had grown more common, and to top it off she felt a constant ache in her bones. 
She was starting to feel like an old lady, and she hated every minute of it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>So when the scan results came in, she was looking 
forward to figuring out what was wrong and how it could be fixed. That feeling 
lasted right up until the moment where she read the first line on the results 
monitor, the line that gave her a diagnosis, the line that changed everything.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Then she read further on, and everything changed 
again.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
"I'm pregnant."

<p>
</p>
<p>She had been avoiding Melarius ever since the results 
came in. He'd been so caught up in planning the rebellion that he hadn't even 
noticed. At one level Vania was frustrated at that, at his constant 
prioritization of the masses over her, but she knew that he couldn't be faulted 
for it. And besides, it had given her some much-needed time to think about the 
future.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>They were in his quarters now, sitting at a table in 
the kitchen section. He had a cup of coffee; she had a glass of tri-filtered 
water. The lights were too bright.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He took a sip of his coffee. "I'm happy, you 
understand," he said. "I'm very happy. I have no energy left, no energy at all, 
but if I did, I'd be jumping around and yelling like a fool."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She smiled at that, and put his hand on his. "There's 
more," she said.</p>
<p>
</p>
"Twins?" he asked.

<p>
</p>
<p>She gave a quick, explosive laugh, almost a bark. "No, 
no. Not twins. But more than a handful."</p>
<p>
</p>
"I don't understand."

<p>
</p>
"The baby has defects."

<p>
</p>
<p>His free hand froze in place, holding the cup halfway 
to his face. "Defects."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Congenital defects both mental and physical. It's 
called <i>Predicatus Ingvarius</i>. The baby'll be fine for the first few 
months, but then its health will start to deteriorate rapidly. It'll eventually 
stabilize at a non-lethal level, but not before it suffers irreversible damage."</p>
<p>
</p>
"How bad?" Melarius asked.

<p>
</p>
<p>"Nobody knows. The first year or two will be filled 
with him contracting every illness known to man, but he should pull through. 
Mental deficiency's a given, so's crippling bouts of pain, and only a small 
percentage avoids a wheelchair. Chances are he'll be able to participate in life 
to some degree - he won't be comatose - but how much he'll be able to understand 
and communicate, well, it depends purely on luck."</p>
<p>
</p>
"It's a he?"

<p>
</p>
She sighed. "Yes. It's a he."

<p>
</p>
<p>Melarius ran his fingers through his hair. "Gods in 
heavens."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"I don't know how we're going to handle it, at least 
not while we don't have a proper base. The med facilities on this ship can 
handle regular illnesses, but they're not even close to dealing with this sort 
of thing. The databanks can diagnose it, but no more. I-"</p>
<p>
</p>
"How far along are you?" he said.

<p>
</p>
"Beg pardon?"

<p>
</p>
"In the pregnancy."

<p>
</p>
She blinked. "Uh, a few weeks."

<p>
</p>
"So there's still time," he said, half to himself.

<p>
</p>
<p>Vania felt herself grow very cold. "Time for what, 
exactly?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He visibly steeled himself, and held on firmly to her 
hand. "To abort the child."</p>
<p>
</p>
"We are not aborting my baby."

<p>
</p>
"Vania-"

<p>
</p>
"We are not aborting my baby."

<p>
</p>
"Look, if you think about this-"

<p>
</p>
"We are <i>not</i> aborting my <i>baby</i>."

<p>
</p>
<p>"Vania, in each life there must be great sacrifices. 
We as a people-"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Oh, for crying out loud!" she yelled. "Don't use that 
voice, not ever again. This is me you're talking to, not an assembly of workers 
on a factory floor."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Melarius kept going, "Do you have any idea what kind 
of life he's going to lead here? Because I don't. I don't know where I'm going 
to be in a week, if I even live that long. You've seen what this kind of life 
does to us, normal people in good health. Can you even imagine bringing a sick 
child into it? What kind of people are we if we consciously allow someone to 
suffer through all the things we have to go through?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"By the time I have the baby, things will be 
different," Vania said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"They certainly will. At best I'll be hip-deep in 
organizing labor unions, governmental committees and militias, running around 
while my child languishes in its lonely crib. More likely I'll be on the run, me 
and you and everyone else here, constantly fighting the State. There'll be no 
money, no proper or consistent health care, and no time even to raise our child, 
let alone take care of its myriad needs. What'll we do if we have to go 
underground for weeks at a time? Could you sit there and watch a sick infant cry 
and scream night after night after night, knowing that its pain won't ever stop 
and that you can do nothing to help it?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Don't you dare make me into the villain here," she 
said. "You don't want this because of the child's well-being; you want to <i>
abort</i> it, for gods' sakes. All you see is a political liability and a threat 
to your precious rebellion. This thing you started has already caused the deaths 
of countless people, including the hundreds of thousands burned up, flash-frozen 
or suffocated when that freighter blew up."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Don't you bring the freighter into this," he said.

<p>
</p>
"Why not? Does it hurt? Does it hurt, Melarius?"

<p>
</p>
"You don't understand-"

<p>
</p>
<p>"How can you care about the lives of people you've 
never even met, and not care about the one single life you are responsible for? 
How does that work? Do you need to be a politician to make sense out of that 
one? Which mask are you wearing now, Mister Politician?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"You don't understand. You don't understand." Melarius 
was looking elsewhere now, up at the ceiling or down at the floor, anything but 
meet Vania's gaze.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"What don't I understand? That you want to lose one 
more life on your road to fame?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Why does this even matter to you?!" he shot back. 
"Yes, this is our child! Yes, if I could change things so that it wouldn't have 
a twisted, horrible life, I would. But I can't! I can't just sit here with you 
and pretend that everything's going to be okay, because I know it won't and you 
know it too. It's an ugly and terrible thing, but it's the truth. Why can't you 
accept that?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"Because I'm the child's <i>mother</i>, that's why!" 
she said.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>He threw up his hands. "And that trumps everything! 
That's the long and the short of it right there, isn't it? I can say anything I 
like, explain the reality of our situation a thousand times, and it still won't 
matter, will it? You say I'm ruled by logic, fine, let's say I am. You're ruled 
by emotions. Will your love cure our child? No, it won't. Will your love keep it 
healthy and happy and pain-free? No, it won't. The only thing your love will do 
is create a human being whose only role in this short and terrible life will be 
to suffer."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She didn't respond, but sat quite still, occasionally 
drying a tear from her eyes. Eventually she said, in a low and quavering voice, 
"This is the first time I have anything to live for beside myself. I am not 
giving that up."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Vania-"

<p>
</p>
<p>"I know I'm selfish. I know. That's how I am; that's 
how I function. I never pretended to be anything else. I left everything behind 
when I followed you, because I thought I'd find something greater to live for 
than myself, but in the end I did it for the same reason I do everything else: 
For me, and me only. This baby will change that."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"This baby will make you a martyr. All it does is let 
you transfer that selfish focus from yourself to our son, and that's not fair on 
anyone. If you want to work out your issues, you have to do it starting with 
yourself, not on someone else by proxy, and least of all on a chronically ill 
child."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Melarius moved his chair closer to Vania's, and 
continued, "We'll try again later. When it's all settled down, however many 
months or years that takes, we'll try again. I'm not opposed to starting a 
family; it's a big step but it's one that I'd like to take. But it needs to be 
on terms we're both happy with."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>"That's all it's about, isn't it?" Vania said. 
"Terms."</p>
<p>
</p>
"I guess so."

<p>
</p>
<p>She dried her eyes and stood. "I think I had better 
leave now."</p>
<p>
</p>
"Okay. We'll talk again later."

<p>
</p>
<p>She turned and, without saying another word, left the 
quarters.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She stayed away from him for a few days after that, 
and when they did pass by one another, they didn't say a word. At last she sent 
him a message asking him if he would change his mind. He replied:</p>
<p>
<i>
</i></p>
Absolutely not. I'm sorry.


<p>
</p>
<p>When she received that reply, she stared at it for a 
good long time before deleting it. Then she started writing a new letter, 
addressed to a Jocasta Meliaan, with the subject line "Your offer." The letter 
began:</p>
<p>
<i>
</i></p>
I'm going to need the finest medical care.
