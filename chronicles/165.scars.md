<p></p>
<p>"You're all right. Come on, take my hand. There you 
go. Let's get you up."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The world was still spinning on strange axes. Olaer 
couldn't see well enough to find his bearings. Colony lights were dim at this 
hour, to keep the inhabitants sedate. It hadn't worked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Someone had helped him to his feet and now had their 
hands wrapped around his shoulders. "Can you stand?" the person said. It was a 
young voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Olaer, who was not young, nodded and set his feet. He 
felt the hand lift gently off him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Thank you," he said. He swayed a little, but remained 
upright. "What is your name?"</p>
<p></p>
"Yane," the young voice said.

<p></p>
<p>Olaer turned to look, and focused as hard as he could. 
His guardian was a Thukker, like himself. Olaer could not remember seeing him on 
the space colony, but in Thukker places this was perfectly normal. Their people 
were travelers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They were in the Great Wildlands, home of the Thukker 
Tribe and current sanctuary for those Starkmanir and Nefantars who had fled or 
been freed from Ammatar and were waiting to be let into the Minmatar Republic 
proper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the meantime, the refugees waited here, guests in 
the place Olaer called home, and when they had nothing to do they found 
something to do. There had been three of them, and they had not been happy to 
hear what Olaer had to say.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He took a step, tumbled, and nearly fell on his face. 
Yane's hands grabbed his shoulder again and pulled him gently upright.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Alright," Yane said. "enough of that. Do you live 
nearby?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>"My name ... my name is Olaer," he replied. It felt 
important he establish this.</p>
<p></p>
"Well then, Olaer. Home?"

<p></p>
<p>"Not that close," Olaer said. It wasn't too far off, 
either, but in his current state he doubted he could even cross the street 
unaided, let alone get home without collapsing from exhaustion. He did not 
intend to have anyone carry him there. He was not that old yet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Then we're going to my place so you can catch your 
breath," Yane said. "I live right over there." He pointed towards a window on 
the other side of the street. "Lucky that I heard the trouble. People don't help 
others out much, in this place."</p>
<p></p>
"No, they don't," Olaer said with regret.

<p></p>
<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>
<p></p>
"So what happened?" Yane said.

<p></p>
<p>Olaer gently rubbed his side and gingerly stretched 
his feet. He was sitting in the apartment's only chair. The adrenaline cloud had 
evaporated, giving way to piercing rays of pain from his battered body.</p>
<p></p>
"I told them who they were," Olaer said.

<p></p>
<p>He looked around. The apartment was dark and bare. It 
was all one room, lit with a single bulb in the ceiling, with no internal walls 
and no apparent source of entertainment except for a bunch of metallic-looking 
blocks in one corner. Beside his chair there was a desk, a metal alloy like 
everything else on the colony, and on the desk there was an old-model datapad 
good for little more than reading and touch-screen writing. There wasn't much 
here to evince a personality, good or bad. But the man had saved him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"And who were they?" Yane said. He was young, probably 
in his late twenties, and looked extremely strong. He carried himself like a man 
wearing heavy armor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Olaer decided to take the plunge. "Traitors. Traitors 
and leeches."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yane raised his eyebrows ."Did you say that to them?" 
he asked with a wide grin. "No wonder they beat you."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Olaer waved his hand, "No, no. Not like that, at 
least. They were being loud and obnoxious, and I was doing my nightly walk in 
the fresh air. Their behavior so annoyed me that I told them they'd be better 
off doing an honest day's work than keeping people up on the colony. So they 
crossed the street and, well, I had a moment to regret my old mouth shooting off 
one last time."</p>
<p></p>
"Why traitors?" Yane asked.

<p></p>
<p>"Thukkers who are moving to the Republic lands. <i>
Settling</i>," he spat the word, "and finding some stability, whatever that 
means in the Thukker head. The Starkies and Nefs, I'll grant, had little choice 
but to come here, even if I wish they'd have retained enough of their dirty 
slave roots to help us with our business. But I've no patience for a Thukker who 
doesn't want to be one. I hope I haven't offended you, in case you're moving as 
well," he said, leaning back in his chair and gently rubbing his hands. "I've 
had my share of beatings for the night."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yane grinned. "It's fine. This ain't much of a home, 
as you can tell. I'm a crewman on a Thukker ship, and I spend most of my time 
out in space. I ain't settling anywhere. Besides," he added, "I've kept an eye 
on the new guys, and I don't like them. At all."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The old man, relieved, said, "I agree. And I generally 
tend to like people. I don't mind these guys for who they are or what they've 
done, and I'd never say no to someone's second chance. But you've got to <i>make</i> 
something of it. Not just run, then expect someone else to solve all your 
problems."</p>
<p></p>
"Didn't used to be like this, I guess," Yane said.

<p></p>
<p>"No, it didn't. People knew who they were and what 
they were capable of, and even the most rootless of meatheads in the Tribe had 
enough sense to act like real men, <i>and</i> enough strength to be criticized 
without turning into monsters."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"The Thukkers that moved to Republic lands, they've 
gotten soft and weak," Yane said, and Olaer wasn't sure which of them was 
echoing the other's thoughts. "Nefantars are either arrogant or kissassy, and 
the Starkmanirs are just ... well, they're simply stupid. You try to talk to 
them and all you see in their eyes is your own reflection, staring back at you."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The old man said, "And I don't like talking about 
people like that-" He sent a stern look to Yane, who had the decency to look 
away, "-But sometimes you <i>can</i> generalize. These poor people haven't been 
properly integrated. And they should be sensible enough to keep their mouths 
shut, their eyes open and their hands in their pockets until they learn the new 
ways. Your past should strengthen you, not be an anchor or a cloak."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yane nodded. "Did you know the Amarrians, even though 
they ban full-body cloning, permit you to be regrown? That's weakness. That 
Aritcio guy they cut up, he's now back in the game, all nice and pretty. They 
should've let him be like he was at the end. Shredded. Let it strengthen him. 
They shouldn't have rebuilt him the way he did."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"You think he would be the same as he is now, if they 
had?" Olaer asked.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I think he'd be honest, to himself and others. And 
he'd have an image that would keep people on their toes. You don't say no to the 
scars."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Something in his voice raised a flag in Olaer's mind, 
but he left it for the time being. He looked around and said, "Looks like a 
typical Thukker apartment. You don't have any problems saying no, I can see. 
What're those metal things in the corner?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yane laughed. "I'm not here very often, and they're 
weights. There's magnetism in them, or something like that, so you can put them 
together or take them apart." He demonstrated, taking two metal blocks and 
holding them up to one another. They grabbed on with a clang. Yane let go with 
one hand, letting the blocks hang perpendicular from the other. He grabbed hold 
again, twisted the blocks slightly, and they detached.</p>
<p></p>
"Simple, clean and definite," Olaer said.

<p></p>
<p>"Damn straight," Yane said. "When I'm here, I 
weightlift as much as I can, often to the point where I can't even hold my pen."</p>
<p></p>
"So you write as well?"

<p></p>
<p>"When my hands stop shaking, yeah," Yane said with a 
shyish grin. He walked over to the desk and picked up the pen and pad, then 
started slowly pacing the room, scribbling aimlessly on its surface. "I like to 
keep them in use. Keep moving."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Do you write a lot?" Olaer said. It felt important, 
though he couldn't say why.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Yeah, actually I do. About anything, really. And we 
agree on the immigrants, by the way," he added. "I don't mean to be insulting 
when I talk about them, and I definitely don't hate my own people. But I think 
you and I, we agree. We're approaching the same destination, maybe just from 
opposite directions." </p>
<p></p>
Olaer looked at him and at the pen in his hands.

<p></p>
<p>"What do you see?" Yane asked. He came to a stop by 
the weight blocks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I should be seeing the weightlifting, because it fits 
you. That pen should stick out like an eyesore in this barren image of power you 
project. If I were a foolish man who did not pay attention to my surroundings 
and the people around me - like I believe some of the new arrivals do, though 
not all of them by far - I would think it strange that someone who clearly lives 
for the strength, and projects this kind of image, would be writing at all."</p>
<p></p>
<p>He stood up, grateful that his legs didn't complain, 
and walked over to Yane. "But I don't find it strange. Because you're the 
opposite. You're a thinking man clad in an exterior of strength and an aura of 
bullishness. Why?"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yane gave him a strange, long look. He walked back to 
the desk and put away the datapad, then rested his hands on the back of the 
chair, his back to Olaer. He sighed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"My family travelled," he said. "Sometimes for 
business, and sometimes to escape trouble. One trip, we were on the run and only 
found port in a dark colony that catered to bad people. It was hard times and we 
had to make our stay there, no matter who else was in that place. You know how 
much politics matters when you're a kid in a strange place? Nothing."</p>
<p></p>
<p>He turned to face Olaer, and said in a voice overlaid 
with glass strength, "And I met this Amarr girl. She was with her own family of 
missionary businessmen. We were ten. Stupid puppy love."</p>
<p></p>
<p>He reached out without looking and picked up the pen 
from the datapad, hefted it in his hand like a spear. "And then my parents found 
out. They and everyone else. Like I said, it was dark times."</p>
<p></p>
Olaer's mouth felt dry. "What did they do to you?"

<p></p>
<p>In a voice that sounded like he was talking as much to 
himself as anyone in the room, Yane said, "I am going to show you something I 
have not shown to many."</p>
<p></p>
<p>He took off his shirt and turned. The single light 
reflected off the destroyed skin on his back. The scars ran so deep it was as if 
they had penetrated to the bone. In the glare they reminded Olaer of ridges in a 
valley of fire; like lines on the eye of the sun, brighter than bright.</p>
<p></p>
"What happened to you?" he whispered.

<p></p>
"I was rebuilt. The Thukker way."

<p></p>
<p>Olaer had to lean against a wall. For a while there 
was silence in the room, and the old man listened hard for the quiet noise of 
the night outside, if only to remind himself that civilization still existed.</p>
<p></p>
"What do you write?" he said at last.

<p></p>
<p>Yane nodded, as if the old man had confirmed 
something. "Whatever I need to get out of my head," he answered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Olaer took a breath, thought for a moment, then ambled 
over to the weights. He ran his finger over one of the blocks. It was cold, and 
its scratches and discoloration spoke of heavy use. "When you're not saving 
defenseless people from the attentions of the mob."</p>
<p></p>
Yane's gaze narrowed. "Yes."

<p></p>
"Have you risen above your past, you think?"

<p></p>
"<i>Yes</i>." The word came out like a whip.

<p></p>
<p>"You mentioned Aritcio. You clearly keep an eye on 
him."</p>
<p></p>
"I pay attention to politics," Yane said.

<p></p>
"What are the five houses of Amarr?"

<p></p>
<p>"Ardishapur, Kor-Azor, Sarum obviously, Tash-Murkon 
and Kador."</p>
<p></p>
<p>"What was the name of the assassinated 
second-in-command of the Caldari State?"</p>
Yane stared at him.

<p></p>
<p>Olaer nodded, and hobbled back to the chair. His legs 
really were starting to hurt. He sat down and rubbed his shins.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"Your attentions are quite focused, young man," he 
said. "Narrowly, even." He took a deep breath. "Sounds to me like you haven't 
entirely let go."</p>
<p></p>
<p>The light reflected off the young man's scars. Olaer 
realized he hadn't witnessed what happened to the assailants. He had heard 
someone intervene, under the beatings and his rapidly fading consciousness, and 
when he awoke they were all gone. It seemed like it should matter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I don't know what you're thinking, but you're wrong," 
Yane said in a dead tone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I think you're very lonely," Olaer said. He got up to 
his feet and made his way over to Yane. He raised his hand to lay it on the 
young man's shoulder, but Yane said, "Don't," without meeting his gaze.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Olaer sighed and walked away, slowly and carefully, 
out the door and into the night.</p>
