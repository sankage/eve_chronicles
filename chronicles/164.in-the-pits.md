# In the Pits

![In the Pits](images/inthepits.jpg)
<p></p>
<p>In New Eden there was now a war, and in this war the 
capsuleers duked it out in the darker parts of space, and in those parts where 
lawlessness reigned there followed the capsuleers like remoras a type of people 
who would pick off the tattered remains like scraps of flesh from a rapidly 
calcifying bone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They had reached Adek's mining station and torn 
through everything. He was running so fast his lungs burned with the effort.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most parts of the colony were blessedly empty, its 
inhabitants having fled the war zone for fear of capsuleers. And just when those 
who remained had been getting a handle on running the colony with a skeleton 
crew, the scavengers had arrived; a small team of pirates using the capsuleers' 
presence as cover to strip the colonies of all useable hardware.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The thieves had been clever. They'd detonated several 
surface explosives before even venturing into the station, causing several 
colony sections to collapse or decompress. The explosives had been full of 
high-reaction incendiary gas that had eaten into the oxygen onboard the colony. 
The crew that hadn't died from fire or structural collapse had choked to death, 
clawing at their throats. The brave few survivors who had tried to bar the 
pirates' entry in the boarding areas had been killed on the spot, burned and 
shredded beyond recognition by the invaders' lasers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adek rushed to one of the emergency chambers and 
fitted himself inside a spacesuit. It was a clunky thing that would slow him 
down, but he had no idea where he was going, and it might involve one of the 
airless locales. He glanced up at a monitoring screen that scrolled through the 
few rooms still in use, but quickly averted his gaze. It showed him nothing but 
death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He moved on in a delirium of fear, and a few airlocks 
later fell to a choking halt, his legs refusing to hold him up any longer. He 
lay on the ground for entirely too long, eyes shut tight, expecting at any 
moment to feel his skin burst and split under the unyielding glare of the 
scavengers' lasers.</p>
<p></p>

<p>When nothing happened, he risked a small peek and 
found that he'd made it to the Pits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was a vast cavern, full of dark and echo. The 
center portion of its circular floor was a giant gaping maw, a sheer drop many 
storeys down with sharp rocky outcroppings on all sides. Those outcroppings in 
turn were pitted with large holes, each of which had a solid metal covering. The 
floor around Adek was dotted with mining and excavation equipment, with 
everything from pickaxes and miniature mining lasers to multijointed MTACs with 
surface cling abilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was the heart of the operation. The Pits' metal 
core was the first thing that had shown up on surface scanning back when the 
asteroid was being settled, and it remained the main source of the colony's ore 
output. But the rock was a fickle thing. Many of its tunnels, cracks and 
crevices led directly to empty space outside, and more than one exploring miner 
had perished before they'd managed to block off all the holes and properly 
oxygenate the place. Each of these dangerous exits was covered with an automated 
shaft lid. They could be opened remotely on those occasions where a brave 
employee was willing to spelunking, hooked onto a rescue line or strapped into 
an MTAC, but as the entire Pits area had to be evacuated first, this was rarely 
done.</p>
<p></p>
Adek crawled towards the edge.

<p></p>

<p>They'd be coming here soon. They had been murdering 
their way through each section of the colony, clad in combat gear and armed with 
laser guns, and sealing off the parts of their passage to prevent anyone from 
getting around them or backtracking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When a laser weapon fires at human flesh, what happens 
is a sizzling, bubbling explosion. He'd seen the results on the monitors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It really was a long way down. If a body went over the 
security railing and jumped with all its might, it might clear the safety nets 
and the outcroppings below and plunge straight to the bottom. The result would 
be an instant death, not painless but near enough compared to a solid-state 
laser beam bursting through one's chest. The covered holes in the depths of the 
Pits looked like pocked flesh, burnt to cinders. Adek thought he might vomit in 
his suit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He rolled onto his back and waited for the inevitable. 
He tried to empty his mind, but it kept returning to the holes in the rock, and 
to the scavengers rushing in. Entrances and exits. In the haze of adrenaline and 
quiet fear he imagined them rushing into the Pits, running right over him and 
going out the tunnels, into empty space.</p>
<p></p>
He blinked.


<p></p>
<p>All roads led to the Pits. No matter where the 
invaders were, they would eventually find their way here. It was the most 
important part of the colony, for if something were to go wrong here, either 
with the equipment or the place itself, it would be much harder to contain and 
correct than in any of the smaller, sealed-off corridors that snaked their way 
through the rest of the base.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adek rolled onto his stomach again and stared into the 
Pits. There were several tunnels down there, shut and sealed off, that he knew 
led straight into space.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A small, stupid hope arose in his mind. It was so 
faint that he did not even dare acknowledge it. Instead, he got up and walked up 
to the nearest MTAC, a metal skeleton used for heavy-duty mining work. He 
activated its wireless controlling unit and grabbed its remote, then rushed to 
the corridor that led to the Pits' control area.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though the entire area was still quite well 
oxygenated, he kept his suit on. He made his way to the elevator and took it 
upstairs, counting the seconds it took him to arrive. He stepped out and into 
the central control room, whose windows overlooked the entirety of the Pits. It 
functions were focused almost solely on this core of the colony, but there were 
a few concessions to life outside the Pits, mainly in the form of activity 
detectors. If the doors that connected outlying colony sections were put into 
use, it would show up here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adek keyed in his security code and sounded a general 
alarm. Klaxons blared in the Pits and computerized voices called out danger. 
Immediately, he saw increased activity of movement that steadily crept closer to 
his area. The scavengers were coming.</p>

<p></p>
<p>He waited and watched through the windows above, 
feeling entirely too calm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When they finally came, little figures trickling in 
through the doors far below, he detached his facemask, turned off his oxygen 
flow, ran to a corner in the room and vomited so hard he thought he'd torn 
something inside himself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As soon as he could, he stumbled back to the control 
desk. The intruders were moving about in the Pits, trying to figure out the 
source of the problem. Adek checked the motion detectors and saw a couple more 
blink. Two more men entered the Pits right after, and the detectors fell silent. 
They were all there.</p>
<p></p>
Adek's stomach lurched.

<p></p>
<p>Everyone who ever worked in the Pits learned the 
override sequence. There was only one, and you hoped you would never in your 
life have to use it.</p>

<p></p>
<p>He keyed it in. Down in the Pits, metal shutters 
clanged down and shut off every single entrance to the area. Adek imagined the 
noise they'd have made, but the echoing blare from the klaxons drowned out all 
other sound. The intruders looked around in panic, hefting their lasers at dark 
crevices. Adek said a silent thanks to whoever had thought to set the control 
room so high, outside of their view.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was another sequence that allowed you to open 
the holes in the Pits, but it wouldn't work on its own. All it would do was 
disengage the regular locks, but if the Pits had gone into lockdown mode the 
holes wouldn't open automatically.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unless one had an agent on location, as it were. Adek 
hefted his MTAC remote.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before the astonished eyes of the murderous intruders, 
one of the MTACs lurched into action, walked past them, broke through the 
security railing and launched itself into the Pits. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It landed in the security net, cut its way through and 
ended up on one of the ledges below, a drop that took several seconds but was 
still well above the final pit. The ledge it lay on led to one of the blocked 
tunnels.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The MTAC walked from the precipice over to the sealed 
tunnel, hefted a limb armed with a mining laser and started burning through the 
door.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It took a while, and to their credit the intruders 
didn't take long to kick into action. Various sections on the MTAC's skeleton 
blinked under kaleidoscopic laser fire, but the scavengers' weapons were 
antipersonnel guns and did little to harm the machine. By the time one of them 
finally ventured into the Pits and started carefully climbing down to the ledge, 
it was too late. Adek saw the door give way and set the MTAC to push forward 
with all its might. It did, the pistons in its metal legs shoving against the 
rock, and the door slowly crumpled inward under its thrust.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Its journey from here on would be blind, but that was 
immaterial. Adek called up schematics of this tunnel and saw that it led in a 
nearly straight line to its crevice point. He set the MTAC to march forward, 
mining laser held forth, and waited.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By the time the intrepid scavenger had made it down to 
the tunnel mouth, the MTAC reported resistance. It had reached the wall. Adek 
forced it forward as hard as he could.</p>
<p></p>

<p>At first there was nothing. The signal from the remote 
merely blinked off, and for a frozen second of terror Adek thought the machine 
had broken. Then there was a rumble, as if an animal were waking from its sleep, 
and Adek saw the intruders scramble for the doors, banging on them and firing 
with their lasers. He smiled. The MTAC had gone through; the Pits had been 
ruptured. Space was claiming its own.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As several warnings sounded in the room, of low 
oxygen, low pressure and critical danger, Adek calmly re-attached his face mask 
and sealed off his suit. He took one last look out the window and couldn't help 
but laugh as he saw the vultures clinging pitifully to whatever they could. One 
or two had lost their grips and were being sucked into the Pits already, to be 
tossed out into space like refuse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They all wore suits, though, and once all the air went 
out of the area, they would be able to move again. He couldn't risk that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He made his way to the elevators and went down to a 
storage area on the ground floor, next to the Pits. There was a small squadron 
of MTACs here, many of whom were outfitted for dead space work. He got into one, 
checked that the claws on its limbs were in good function, and used its arm to 
unseal the door into the Pits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Immediately he felt the drag, as if his body wanted to 
freefall. The pull was immense. Thankfully, the MTACs claws gripped the floor 
with ease.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The intruders noticed him, their eyes wide with shock 
and anger, but the few that remained were no threat. Most suits had emergency 
wire loops that let you lasso yourself to some fixed spot, and a few of the 
intruders had managed this. Unfortunately for them, their weapons hadn't been 
fixed in the same way, and all they could do was flail madly as Adek approached.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He raised his machine hand, and he cut through their 
wires.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most of them panicked and some visibly screamed inside 
their masks. One or two even refused to tumble away and instead grabbed on to 
the mechanical arm, where they clung on for dear life. He bashed them against 
the wall until they broke or let go.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before too long, it was over. Adek was alone. He 
marched his MTAC back through the empty Pits and into the control section, 
closed it and sealed it, and got as far as the elevator entrance before 
collapsing in tears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eventually he hauled himself back up and took the 
elevator to the top floor, where he entered the control room and inspected the 
damage from up high.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Everything that had not been nailed down in the Pits 
was gone, including the intruders. It was as if God had swept his hand over the 
earth and started anew.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Adek was about to remove his facemask when a motion 
light lit up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He froze. It was one door, on the outer rim of the 
colony. Someone had stayed behind. One of the invaders was alive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The light lit again, and again, each time a little 
closer to the control room.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was the end, Adek thought. Everything was over. 
The whole world as he knew it would be extinguished.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For no reason other than to have something to do, he 
cast his view outside his little world, using the control room's scanners to 
check on traffic elsewhere in the solar system. He discovered that the 
capsuleers had come. One of them was even tooling around quite nearby.</p>
<p></p>

<p>He considered sending a plea for help, but discounted 
the idea. You didn't ask the gods of destruction to help you in times of need.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adek drummed his fingers on the control panel. The 
gods of <i>destruction</i> were here. There was a <i>god</i> of <i>destruction</i> 
outside his colony.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The capsuleers were <i>hungry</i> gods, whimsical and 
easy to anger. And it occurred to Adek that it was, in fact, possible to call on 
the powers of the gods. One merely needed to present a worthy sacrifice.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The little part of his mind that had cut the wires 
down in the Pits now took over again. He typed out a message and set it to 
general broadcast. It wouldn't reach far, for the colony had only limited 
transmission rights, but if he were lucky it would reach far enough. He keyed it 
to send, then checked the motion sensors. The scavenger was approaching fast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adek swiftly resealed his helmet and fled the control 
room, running down a different corridor that would lead him to the emergency 
supplies warehouse. From there he would be cut off, with no escape routes and no 
way back to the colony proper. He'd be a rat in a cage.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He reached the warehouse and immediately sealed its 
door. It wouldn't hold back a man with a laser, at least not for very long, but 
then, nothing would last for very long, one way or another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adek searched quickly until he found an interstellar 
transport container. This one was as large as an empty house, cold and austere. 
He unsealed one of its entry points, pulled it open and entered. It was freezing 
cold inside, but his suit would protect him from the worst. He sealed the door 
from the inside, found his way over to the personnel transport section, strapped 
himself in and waited.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He imagined the progression of events. By now the 
intruder might have found his way to the control room, where he would see the 
message being broadcast to the capsuleer. Even if the intruder shot the control 
board to bits, the message would continue to be relayed. It was a summons to the 
capsuleer, announcing that the station had been overrun with hostile pirates and 
that he was to destroy the place, rescue its precious cargo and get out before 
being swarmed by enemy forces.</p>

<p></p>
<p>It wasn't a total lie, Adek reasoned to himself. He 
was very precious cargo. There was only one of him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There was a muted hissing noise in the distance. The 
intruder was making his way through the warehouse doors.</p>
<p></p>
Adek closed his eyes, breathed deeply and prayed.

<p></p>
<p>Before too long, the hissing noise was overtaken by a 
rumbling tremor. The container, which must have weighed a ton, began to shake. 
The noise rose to deafening levels. Explosions sounded somewhere in the 
distance.</p>
<p></p>
Adek prayed.

<p></p>

The gods were coming.
