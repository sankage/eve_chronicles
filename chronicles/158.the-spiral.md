# "The Spiral"

"This is a spiral we're in; a long wave undulating in   one constant direction without ever crashing on the shore. Listen."
  

I sat with them in the mess hall of our new ship. Some   of these people I had worked with for years. Others were new to me, and had   joined as parts of a process that now felt like a procession.
  

"Everything leads you to where you are."

I was a member of the Sanctuary, a corporation that   belonged to the benevolent Sisters of EVE. While the Sisters as a whole   concerned themselves with the betterment of mankind, their subfactions went   about achieving that goal in entirely different ways. The Sisters of EVE   corporation, which was the largest part of the Sisters of EVE faction, consisted   of rescue workers and aid specialists, and all in all were the exact kind of   people you wanted to see in the aftermath of a cataclysm. The Food Relief   corporation, meanwhile, concerned itself with the bureaucracy of aid, and had a   tendency to extend its reach into diplomatic matters.
  

The last of the Sister faction corporations - my own   home and the domain of my calling -was the Sanctuary. They were a scientifically   focused organization working within a faith-based dominion, and the combined   focus of secular inquiry and religious discipline lent a particular fervor to   their work. Their focus was the EVE gate, a wormhole that had collapsed onto   itself thousands of years ago and left humanity stranded in New Eden. In recent   times, a massive interstellar war that cost innumerable lives had also seen an   increase in activity at the EVE gate. A team, led by me, had been investigating   this new anomaly, and had eventually uncovered a strange signature, as if the   gate were responding to something elsewhere in the cosmos.
  

The signature was unrelated to any previous data and   was thus discounted by most serious researchers. But I felt it was worth looking   into. I believed that everything happened for a reason, and that the great gate   would not grant me this single key unless it had something to unlock.
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

It took a lot of patience, which sometimes ran dry,   and energy, which was often used up, but eventually I made the connection. Many   things had been happening when the gate started to pulsate, but one of the more   notable events was the Minmatar invasion of Amarr space, and the re-emergence of   Heir Jamyl Sarum, who repelled the invaders at her doorstep.
  

The conflict, which had seen a massive fleet of   warships torn to shreds, was shrouded in mystery and rumor. Some said Jamyl had   merely willed the Minmatar ships to explode; others, that the fabled Minmatar   Elders had seen their invasion brought to a halt and had enacted a suicide pact.   There were rumors of an Amarr superweapon couched inside an Abaddon battleship,   but nothing had been proven and no public data was available.
  

Whatever it was, the invasion event coincided with a   spike in EVE gate activity. Moreover, once I had carefully picked apart the   scant data on record from that momentous day in the skies above Mekhios, I   discovered traces of that very same signature found in the EVE gate. The two   were connected, I reasoned; the two must be connected. I knew I was on to   something.
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

Acquiring a small vessel and a few stores of   investigative equipment - interest in the gate ran high in the Sanctuary, and my   once-strict overseers found themselves perfectly willing to let their people   engage in all sorts of strange excursions - I started a research experiment to   determine whether the anomalous signature could be found anywhere else in New   Eden. Despite the scant evidence I had to work with, I had to fight the constant   urge to bring the entirety of my corporation onboard. The further I travelled   along this dark new road, the more certain I was that I had been set on it for   some reason that would eventually involve the fates of all my brothers. That   certainty was only compounded when I travelled to Mekhios and found not only   clear traces of the signature, but indicators of where else it might be found.   Those indicators took the form of tiny rips in space, little pockets of anomaly   where the laws of physics was turned inside out. They were too small to affect   the ships that passed through them, and much too volatile to be of any use for   scientific study. But they were there, present - inasmuch as the window to   another world can be said to exist at all - and like my own titanium faith, a   similar window to another world of strange wonders, they led inexorably to my   ultimate goal.
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  

Like starry lights the little rips led me on a brief   and hair-raising series of excursions, but only once did I risk losing my trail.   It was on a jaunt into the deeps of Blood Raider space. The Blood Raiders, a   gruesome and spacefaring sect of blood-worshiping cult called the Sani Sabik,   had been involved in an assault on a station there, and little pools of   antireality eddied around the place. It was as if the trail led in several   different directions, one of whom seemed to go only deeper into the abyss of the   Blood Raider world. I briefly considered following it, but resisted the   temptation and set my gaze on a safe trail that led into Empire space again.   There would be time enough to traverse the darker roads.
  

That trail led me to the high faithful: The court of   the Amarr Empire. Despite our differences, I could not help but respect those   people and the immense power their faith had granted them.
  

Their presence in this world was impressive, too.   Colossal ships hovered past me in every direction, the golden sheen of their   hulls reflecting the fire of the sun. In the distance I could glimpse the   Empress's home at the Family Academy station in Amarr, and the caravans docking   there bore the insignia and banners of high royalty. It made me wistful for   something I couldn't explain: not a past I had missed, for the paths of my   ancestry had never crossed those of the high royalty, but perhaps a future that   might hold greater glory than I had ever imagined.
  

So I thought intently, and I formulated a plan, and I   snuck my ship into the holiest of holies apparently undetected, looking with   manic fervor for something I did not yet understand and, I increasingly feared,   might not even recognize if I found it. The signature was there but so were   guard ships, and while I trusted my Sisters reputation to get me at the least   through the outer circles of Amarr security, I was certain that at some point I   would find myself in the unwilling company of armed men with little inclination   to do anything but ask me stern questions at gunpoint, much less grant open   passage. I sampled what data I could, my minute vessel dwarfed by the warships   that idled by, and I got out in the assured belief that my presence there had   not been noted or understood.
  

<p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">***</p>  <p align="CENTER" dir="LTR">  </p>
Back at the Sisters base I spent several days and   nights crunching the data, fuelled by the blinding fire of a righteous faith in   my cause. I eventually found that I'd been close to the source already, for the   latest data indicated that the signature was most present in T-IPZB, the depths   of Blood Raider territory. It was a frightening and ecstatic moment, to realize   that the trail went ever on and would lead me into the darkest of space. But I   believed, in myself and in this.
  

To mount an expedition into Blood Raider space would   require a proper crew on a proper ship outfitted with the equipment and supplies   necessary for such a hazardous venture. It would also require official   permission, which I duly requested, and which was summarily denied.
  

I was crushed, reduced to ashes and dust. My visions   of a grand future, though barely formed, threatened to unravel already. The   world was in the midst of interstellar war, the Sisters said, and while they   respected the rights of their Sanctuary workers to continue their scientific   inquiries, there were no ships, supplies or anything else they could spare to   that effect.
  

It was absolutely ridiculous, and it would have been   laughable were it not so tragic. I could feel the spiral of events, this path I   was on, curl and turn into a noose. I knew exactly where I needed to go and even   had some inkling of the 'why'; a tenuous 'why', certainly, but I had faith and   knew it was a necessary thing.
  

In my desperation I started sharing information with   anyone who would listen. I kept the destination to myself, but let enough slip   that people knew I had an extremely important mission to undertake, one that   involved the EVE gate, the Blood Raiders, and very possibly the truth of what   happened on that fateful day of the Minmatar invasion.
  

And just like that, the noose relaxed. It had been   like this, always and always, when we wanted to help the people who needed our   aid. The world found a way for us, and whatever needed to happen it made happen   for us. I felt blessed and exonerated.
  

I was given the ship, and given the supplies, and   granted the crew.

I looked over my people. We would go somewhere no one   had ever gone, and play our part in the grand scheme.
  

Everything leads you to where you are, I said to them.   I gave them my name, and we moved on in faith.
