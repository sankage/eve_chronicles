# The Day of Darkness

The Day of Darkness was properly named. That day saw one of the worst storms
ever on the biggest continent on Matar, laying incredible amount of destruction
in few short hours. But greater danger loomed, because that same day six giant
slave vessels entered the Pator system. From there each ship set out for a
different Minmatar planet, escorted by heavily armed military ships. Once in
orbit the Amarrians descended onto the surface and started rounding up people.
The Minmatars put up a brave resistance, but to no avail, the superior Amarr
technology swept all Minmatar armed forces away, then plundered the populace at
will. In addition, the Amarrians took great care of destroying every Minmatar
space ship and installation they encountered, with the intent of making it very
difficult for the Minmatars to gain strong space presence.

The Amarrians enslaved hundreds of millions of Minmatar in that first raid. Over
the next millennium they would repeat their slave raids with regularity,
capturing hundreds of millions more and throwing the Minmatar nation into a
state of confusion, sorrow and insecurity.
